# How Bridges Work — Curriculum Overview

## About This Course

An introductory course on bridge engineering, designed as a demonstration for the gap-map diagnostic system. Covers the fundamental forces at work in bridges and how different bridge types handle those forces.

No exam board — this is a standalone teaching resource.
