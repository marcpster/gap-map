# 1. Forces and Loads

## Key Concepts

### 1.1 Compression and Tension
- **Compression** — a pushing force that squeezes material together (e.g. a column holding up a roof)
- **Tension** — a pulling force that stretches material apart (e.g. a cable supporting a deck)
- Every structural element in a bridge is primarily in either compression or tension
- Materials behave differently under each: concrete is strong in compression, steel is strong in tension

### 1.2 Equilibrium
- A bridge that isn't moving or collapsing is in **equilibrium** — all forces balance out
- The downward forces (loads) must be matched by upward reaction forces from the supports
- If forces become unbalanced, the structure deforms or fails

### 1.3 Dead Loads and Live Loads
- **Dead load** — the permanent weight of the bridge itself (deck, cables, towers, foundations)
- **Live load** — temporary forces: traffic, pedestrians, wind, snow
- Engineers must design for the worst-case combination of both
- Live loads are harder to predict because they change constantly

### 1.4 How Forces Travel Through Structures
- Forces don't just act at one point — they travel through the structure to the foundations
- The **load path** traces how a force moves from where it's applied down to the ground
- Bridges redirect forces: a suspension cable converts a downward load into tension along the cable, which pulls on the tower, which pushes down into the foundation in compression
- Understanding load paths is the key to understanding why different bridge shapes work

## Common Misconceptions

- **"Bridges are held up by their own strength"** — bridges are held up by the ground via their foundations; the structure redirects forces to the supports
- **"Heavier bridges are stronger"** — weight is a load, not a source of strength; engineers try to minimise dead load
- **"Compression and tension are the same thing"** — they're opposites; compression pushes inward, tension pulls outward
- **"A bridge in equilibrium has no forces on it"** — equilibrium means forces balance, not that they're absent
- **"Live loads are always bigger than dead loads"** — for many bridges the dead load (self-weight) is far greater than the traffic it carries
- **"Forces only push downwards"** — loads create compression, tension, and sometimes lateral forces depending on the structure's geometry

### Q1 — Compression vs tension
**Area:** 1.1 Compression and tension
**Question:** "When you stand on a wooden plank bridging a gap, the top surface of the plank and the bottom surface are experiencing different forces. What's happening to each surface?"
**Looking for:** The top surface is in compression (being squashed) and the bottom surface is in tension (being stretched). A strong answer mentions that the plank bends, putting the top in compression and the bottom in tension simultaneously.

### Q2 — Equilibrium
**Area:** 1.2 Equilibrium
**Question:** "A footbridge has a lorry parked in the middle of it, but the bridge isn't moving or breaking. What does that tell you about the forces acting on it?"
**Looking for:** The bridge is in equilibrium — the downward force from the lorry's weight (plus the bridge's own weight) is balanced by upward reaction forces at the supports. All forces cancel out, so there's no movement.

### Q3 — Dead vs live loads
**Area:** 1.3 Dead loads and live loads
**Question:** "Engineers talk about 'dead loads' and 'live loads' on a bridge. What do you think the difference is, and can you give an example of each?"
**Looking for:** Dead load = the permanent weight of the bridge structure itself. Live load = temporary or changing forces like traffic, people, wind, or snow. A strong answer recognises that both must be accounted for in design.

### Q4 — Load paths
**Area:** 1.4 How forces travel through structures
**Question:** "When a car drives across a suspension bridge, the weight doesn't just push straight down through the deck. How does the force actually get from the car down to the ground?"
**Looking for:** The deck transfers the load to the vertical hangers (tension), which pull on the main cables (tension), which pull on the towers (compression downward into foundations). The force follows a path through different structural elements, changing between tension and compression along the way.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "If concrete is strong in compression but weak in tension, why do you think engineers put steel bars inside it?"
- "A bridge is sitting there with nothing on it — are there any forces acting on it?"
- "Which do you think weighs more: a big motorway bridge, or all the cars that could fit on it at once?"
- "If I cut one of the cables on a suspension bridge, what would happen to the forces in the other cables?"
