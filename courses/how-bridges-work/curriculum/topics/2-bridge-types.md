# 2. Bridge Types

## Key Concepts

### 2.1 Beam Bridges
- The simplest type — a horizontal deck resting on supports at each end
- The deck bends under load: top in compression, bottom in tension
- Limited span — the longer the beam, the more it bends and the stronger (heavier) it must be
- Most short bridges (footbridges, motorway overpasses) are beam bridges

### 2.2 Arch Bridges
- The curved shape converts downward loads into compression along the arch
- Forces travel outward along the curve and into the ground at the abutments
- Very efficient because the whole arch is in compression, and stone/concrete handle compression well
- The abutments must resist the outward horizontal thrust — the arch pushes outward, not just downward
- Ancient technology — Roman arches still stand because the geometry naturally handles compression

### 2.3 Suspension Bridges
- A deck hung from vertical cables (hangers) attached to main cables draped between tall towers
- The main cables are in **tension** — they carry the load by pulling, not pushing
- Towers are in **compression** — the cable tension pulls down on them
- The cables are anchored at each end, transferring the pull into the ground
- Can span very long distances because cables are efficient in tension (light and strong)

### 2.4 Cable-Stayed Bridges
- Cables run directly from the tower(s) to the deck — no main catenary cable
- Cables are in tension, towers in compression (similar to suspension)
- The deck must handle some compression because the angled cables push inward along its length
- Fewer cables needed than suspension bridges, but can't span quite as far
- Visually distinctive — the cables fan out from the tower like a harp or a fan

## Common Misconceptions

- **"Arch bridges are the strongest type"** — "strongest" depends on the context; suspension bridges span much further, and the best type depends on the site, materials, and loads
- **"Suspension cables pull the bridge up"** — the cables don't pull upward; they transfer the deck's weight sideways and down through the towers to the ground
- **"Beam bridges are just planks and not real engineering"** — beam bridges require careful calculation of bending forces, material selection, and reinforcement
- **"Cable-stayed and suspension bridges are the same thing"** — they look similar but the cable geometry and force distribution are fundamentally different
- **"Arches work because the shape is strong"** — the shape works because it keeps the material in compression; if the load pattern changes (e.g. heavy load on one side), the arch can fail
- **"Modern bridges are always better than old ones"** — Roman arch bridges have lasted 2000 years; longevity depends on design, materials, and maintenance, not just era

### Q1 — Beam bridges
**Area:** 2.1 Beam bridges
**Question:** "A simple beam bridge is just a flat deck resting on two supports. Why can't you just make a beam bridge as long as you want?"
**Looking for:** The longer the span, the more the beam bends under its own weight and any loads. Eventually the bending forces (compression on top, tension on the bottom) exceed what the material can handle. You'd need to make it deeper or heavier, which adds dead load, making the problem worse.

### Q2 — Arch bridges
**Area:** 2.2 Arch bridges
**Question:** "Arch bridges have been around since Roman times and many are still standing. What is it about the arch shape that makes it so effective?"
**Looking for:** The curved shape directs forces along the arch into compression. Stone and concrete are excellent in compression. The forces travel outward and downward to the abutments at each end. A strong answer mentions that the arch avoids tension, which is what causes stone to crack.

### Q3 — Suspension bridges
**Area:** 2.3 Suspension bridges
**Question:** "On a suspension bridge, the deck hangs from cables draped between two tall towers. Which parts of the bridge are in tension and which are in compression?"
**Looking for:** Main cables and vertical hangers are in tension (being pulled). Towers are in compression (being pushed downward by the cable forces). The cables transfer the deck's weight to the towers, and the towers push it down into the foundations.

### Q4 — Cable-stayed vs suspension
**Area:** 2.4 Cable-stayed bridges
**Question:** "Cable-stayed bridges and suspension bridges both use cables and towers, but they work differently. What's the main difference in how the cables are arranged?"
**Looking for:** In a suspension bridge, the main cable drapes in a curve between towers and vertical hangers connect it to the deck. In a cable-stayed bridge, cables run directly from the tower to the deck with no main cable. This changes how forces are distributed — cable-stayed decks take more compression because the angled cables push inward along the deck.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "If you had to cross a small stream and only had a wooden plank, what kind of bridge would that be? What limits how wide a stream you could cross?"
- "Why do you think the Romans built so many arch bridges out of stone, rather than other shapes?"
- "On a suspension bridge, what would happen to the towers if you cut the anchor cables at the ends?"
- "Looking at a cable-stayed bridge, why do the cables fan out rather than all connecting to the same point on the deck?"
