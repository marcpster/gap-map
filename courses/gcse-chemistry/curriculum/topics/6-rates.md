# 6. The Rate and Extent of Chemical Change

## Key Concepts

### 4.6.1 Rate of Reaction
- Rate of reaction — how fast reactants are converted to products, measured by quantity of reactant used or product formed per unit time
- Calculating rates from graphs — rate = gradient of the line (steeper = faster)
- Factors affecting rate: temperature, concentration (or pressure for gases), surface area, catalysts
- Collision theory — particles must collide with sufficient energy (≥ activation energy) and correct orientation for a reaction to occur
- Increasing temperature — particles move faster, more frequent collisions, and a greater proportion have energy ≥ activation energy
- Increasing concentration/pressure — more particles in a given volume, more frequent collisions
- Increasing surface area — more particles exposed to react, more frequent collisions
- Catalysts — provide an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy, not used up, don't appear in overall equation

### 4.6.2 Reversible Reactions and Dynamic Equilibrium
- Reversible reactions — products can react to re-form the original reactants (⇌ symbol)
- Energy changes in reversible reactions — if the forward reaction is exothermic, the reverse is endothermic by the same amount
- Dynamic equilibrium (in a closed system) — rate of forward reaction equals rate of reverse reaction, concentrations of reactants and products remain constant
- Effect of changing conditions on equilibrium (HT): increasing temperature favours the endothermic direction; increasing concentration of a reactant shifts equilibrium towards products; increasing pressure (gases) favours the side with fewer moles of gas

## Common Misconceptions

- Catalysts "give energy" to reactions or "make reactions happen" rather than lowering the activation energy
- Increasing temperature creates more particles (it doesn't — particles just move faster and have more energy)
- Equilibrium means equal amounts of products and reactants (it means equal rates, not equal amounts)
- Reversible reactions can only go one way at a time (at equilibrium, both forward and reverse happen simultaneously)
- Surface area only matters for liquids (it applies to solids — smaller pieces = more surface exposed)
- A catalyst is used up during the reaction (it is recovered unchanged)
- Thinking a faster rate means a greater yield (rate and yield are different things)
- Confusing rate of reaction with how much product is made overall

### Q1 — Factors affecting rate
**Area:** 4.6.1 Rate of reaction
**Question:** "If I'm reacting marble chips with hydrochloric acid and I want the reaction to go faster, give me two different things I could change and explain why each one works."
**Looking for:** Any two of: increase temperature (particles move faster, more energetic collisions, more particles exceed activation energy), increase acid concentration (more acid particles in same volume, more frequent collisions), use smaller/crushed marble chips (greater surface area, more particles exposed to acid). Explanation should reference particles and collisions, not just "it goes faster."

### Q2 — Collision theory
**Area:** 4.6.1 Collision theory
**Question:** "Explain why increasing the temperature speeds up a reaction. Try to use the idea of particles and collisions in your answer."
**Looking for:** Higher temperature means particles have more kinetic energy and move faster. Two effects: (1) more frequent collisions, and (2) — crucially — a greater proportion of collisions have energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. The second point is the more important one and the one students often miss.

### Q3 — Catalysts
**Area:** 4.6.1 Catalysts
**Question:** "A catalyst speeds up a reaction. But if you weigh the catalyst before and after the reaction, its mass hasn't changed. So what has it actually done?"
**Looking for:** The catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy. This means more particles have enough energy to react, so the reaction is faster. The catalyst is not used up — it takes part in the reaction but is regenerated. It doesn't change the amount of product made, just how quickly you get there.

### Q4 — Interpreting rate from a graph
**Area:** 4.6.1 Rate of reaction
**Question:** "Imagine a graph showing volume of gas produced against time. The line is steep at the start and then levels off to a flat line. Describe what's happening at each stage."
**Looking for:** Steep section: reaction is fast, gas being produced quickly, plenty of reactant particles available for frequent collisions. Line gets less steep: reaction slowing down, reactant particles being used up, fewer collisions per second. Flat line: reaction has finished, all of the limiting reactant has been used up, no more gas produced. Rate = gradient, so flat = zero rate.

### Q5 — Reversible reactions
**Area:** 4.6.2 Reversible reactions
**Question:** "The reaction A + B ⇌ C + D is reversible and the forward reaction is exothermic. What can you tell me about the energy change of the reverse reaction?"
**Looking for:** The reverse reaction is endothermic. The energy transferred in the reverse reaction is equal to the energy transferred in the forward reaction (same amount, opposite direction). This is a key feature of all reversible reactions — the energy changes are equal and opposite.

### Q6 — Dynamic equilibrium
**Area:** 4.6.2 Dynamic equilibrium
**Question:** "At equilibrium, we say the reaction 'hasn't stopped.' What do we mean by that, and what has to be true about the rates of the forward and reverse reactions?"
**Looking for:** At dynamic equilibrium, both forward and reverse reactions are still happening — it's not that nothing is going on. The rate of the forward reaction equals the rate of the reverse reaction. As a result, the concentrations of reactants and products stay constant (not necessarily equal, just constant). Must be in a closed system so nothing escapes.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "If I crush the marble chips into powder, the reaction finishes faster. Has that changed how much gas I get in total, or just how quickly I get it?"
- "Why does heating a reaction up speed it up? Is it just because the particles move faster, or is there more to it?"
- "A catalyst speeds up the reaction but isn't used up. How is that possible — what's it actually doing?"
- "Look at this rate graph — the line goes steep then flat. What does the gradient tell you at each point?"
- "If the forward reaction gives out heat, what happens when I heat the equilibrium mixture? Which direction does it shift and why?"
- "Someone says 'equilibrium means equal amounts of products and reactants.' Do you agree?"
