# 9. Chemistry of the Atmosphere

## Key Concepts

### 4.9.1 The Composition and Evolution of the Earth's Atmosphere
- Current composition — approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, ~1% argon, ~0.04% carbon dioxide, plus trace amounts of water vapour and other gases
- The Earth's early atmosphere — thought to have been mainly carbon dioxide with little or no oxygen (similar to Mars and Venus today), plus water vapour and small amounts of other gases released by volcanic activity
- How oxygen increased — early algae and plants evolved and carried out photosynthesis, releasing oxygen over billions of years; oxygen built up gradually as photosynthetic organisms spread
- How carbon dioxide decreased — dissolved in the oceans, was locked up in sedimentary rocks (e.g. limestone) and fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) formed from dead organisms, and was used by plants for photosynthesis

### 4.9.2 Carbon Dioxide and Methane as Greenhouse Gases
- The greenhouse effect — greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, water vapour) absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and re-emit it in all directions, warming the atmosphere; this is a natural process that keeps the Earth warm enough to support life
- Human activities increasing greenhouse gases — burning fossil fuels (CO2), deforestation (less CO2 absorbed by trees), agriculture and livestock farming (methane from cattle and rice paddies), landfill sites (methane from decomposing waste)
- Global climate change — consequences include ice cap melting, sea level rise, more extreme weather events (floods, droughts, storms), changes to ecosystems and loss of habitats, shifts in food production
- The carbon footprint — total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted over the full life cycle of a product, service or event; can be reduced by using renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, carbon capture and storage, reducing waste

### 4.9.3 Common Atmospheric Pollutants and Their Sources
- Combustion of fossil fuels produces: carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas), carbon monoxide (toxic — binds to haemoglobin, preventing oxygen transport), sulfur dioxide (causes acid rain), nitrogen oxides (cause acid rain and photochemical smog), particulates (soot — cause global dimming and respiratory problems)
- Sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides dissolve in rainwater to form acid rain, which damages buildings, harms aquatic life and kills plants
- Particulates contribute to global dimming (reducing the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface) and cause respiratory health problems
- Carbon monoxide is colourless and odourless, making it particularly dangerous — produced by incomplete combustion

## Common Misconceptions

- The greenhouse effect is entirely bad — students don't realise it's a natural and essential process that keeps Earth habitable; the problem is the enhanced greenhouse effect from human activity
- Ozone depletion and global warming are the same thing — these are separate environmental issues with different causes
- The atmosphere has always had the same composition — students forget it evolved dramatically over billions of years
- Carbon dioxide is the only greenhouse gas — methane and water vapour are also significant greenhouse gases
- All pollution comes from cars — power stations, industry, agriculture and domestic heating all contribute significantly
- Oxygen has always been in the atmosphere — there was little or no oxygen in the early atmosphere before photosynthesis evolved
- Acid rain is caused only by carbon dioxide — sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides are the main causes of acid rain

### Q1 — Current atmospheric composition
**Area:** 4.9.1 The composition and evolution of the Earth's atmosphere
**Question:** "What gases make up the Earth's atmosphere today, and roughly what proportion is each one?"
**Looking for:** Approximately 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, about 1% argon, and around 0.04% carbon dioxide. Students often forget nitrogen is the dominant gas or guess that oxygen is the most abundant. May also mention small amounts of water vapour and other trace gases.

### Q2 — How the atmosphere evolved
**Area:** 4.9.1 The composition and evolution of the Earth's atmosphere
**Question:** "The Earth's atmosphere used to be very different. What was the early atmosphere like, and how did it change to what we have today?"
**Looking for:** Early atmosphere was mainly carbon dioxide (possibly with water vapour and other volcanic gases), with little or no oxygen — similar to Mars and Venus today. Oxygen was produced by photosynthesising organisms (first algae, then plants) over billions of years. Carbon dioxide decreased because it dissolved in the oceans, was locked into sedimentary rocks and fossil fuels, and was used by plants. Understanding that this was a gradual process over a very long timescale.

### Q3 — The greenhouse effect
**Area:** 4.9.2 Carbon dioxide and methane as greenhouse gases
**Question:** "Explain how the greenhouse effect works. Is it always a bad thing?"
**Looking for:** Greenhouse gases (CO2, methane, water vapour) in the atmosphere absorb infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and re-emit it in all directions, including back towards the ground. This keeps the Earth warm enough to support life — so it's a natural and essential process, not inherently bad. The problem is the enhanced greenhouse effect: human activities are increasing greenhouse gas levels, trapping more heat and causing global warming.

### Q4 — Human causes of climate change
**Area:** 4.9.2 Carbon dioxide and methane as greenhouse gases
**Question:** "What human activities are causing greenhouse gas levels to rise, and what are the consequences of this for the planet?"
**Looking for:** Burning fossil fuels releases CO2. Deforestation means fewer trees absorbing CO2. Agriculture (cattle and rice paddies) and landfill produce methane. Consequences include ice cap melting, sea level rise, more extreme weather events, habitat loss and changes to food production. Students should mention more than just "driving cars" — a range of activities and consequences demonstrates deeper understanding.

### Q5 — Carbon footprint
**Area:** 4.9.2 Carbon dioxide and methane as greenhouse gases
**Question:** "What is a carbon footprint, and what are some ways it can be reduced?"
**Looking for:** The total amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases emitted over the full life cycle of a product, service or event. Reduction methods include using renewable energy sources, improving energy efficiency (insulation, efficient appliances), carbon capture and storage technology, reducing car use or switching to electric vehicles, reducing waste and increasing recycling. Good answers recognise it covers the entire life cycle, not just direct emissions.

### Q6 — Atmospheric pollutants
**Area:** 4.9.3 Common atmospheric pollutants and their sources
**Question:** "When fossil fuels burn, they release several pollutants besides carbon dioxide. Name two of these pollutants and explain what problems they cause."
**Looking for:** Any two from: carbon monoxide (toxic — binds to haemoglobin, reducing oxygen transport in the blood; colourless and odourless so hard to detect), sulfur dioxide (dissolves in rainwater to form acid rain — damages buildings, kills fish in lakes, harms plants and trees), nitrogen oxides (also cause acid rain and contribute to photochemical smog), particulates/soot (cause respiratory problems, contribute to global dimming by reflecting sunlight). Strong answers explain the mechanism of harm, not just the name.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

Use these as conversation starters in guided mode. Adapt and follow up freely.

- "If I asked most people what the main gas in our atmosphere is, what do you think they'd say? What's the actual answer?"
- "The early Earth had an atmosphere more like Mars. What changed, and what caused it?"
- "Some people say the greenhouse effect is destroying the planet. Is that fair? What's the difference between the natural greenhouse effect and what's happening now?"
- "Apart from driving, what human activities contribute to climate change? Can you think of any that might surprise people?"
- "What does 'carbon footprint' actually mean? If you wanted to reduce yours, where would you start?"
- "A car engine produces more than just carbon dioxide when it burns petrol. What else comes out, and why should we care?"
