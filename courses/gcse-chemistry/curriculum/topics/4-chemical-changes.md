# 4. Chemical Changes

## Key Concepts

### 4.4.1 Reactivity of Metals
- Metal oxides — metals react with oxygen to form metal oxides, which are bases; oxidation is gain of oxygen, reduction is loss of oxygen
- Reactivity series — potassium, sodium, lithium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium, carbon, zinc, iron, hydrogen, copper, silver, gold (most to least reactive)
- Extraction of metals — metals more reactive than carbon are extracted by electrolysis, metals less reactive than carbon are extracted by reduction with carbon (e.g. iron from iron oxide in a blast furnace)
- Oxidation and reduction in terms of electrons (HT) — oxidation is loss of electrons (OIL), reduction is gain of electrons (RIG)

### 4.4.2 Reactions of Acids
- Acids with metals — acid + metal → salt + hydrogen (only metals above hydrogen in reactivity series)
- Neutralisation — acid + base → salt + water; acid + alkali → salt + water; acid + metal carbonate → salt + water + carbon dioxide
- Making soluble salts — choosing the right acid and base/metal/carbonate to produce the desired salt
- pH scale — 0 to 14; below 7 is acidic, 7 is neutral, above 7 is alkaline; measured with universal indicator or pH meter
- Strong and weak acids (HT) — strong acids fully dissociate in water (e.g. HCl, H2SO4, HNO3), weak acids partially dissociate (e.g. ethanoic acid, citric acid); same concentration can have different pH

### 4.4.3 Electrolysis
- Process of electrolysis — using direct current to decompose ionic compounds; positive ions move to the negative electrode (cathode), negative ions move to the positive electrode (anode)
- Molten ionic compounds — straightforward: metal deposited at cathode, non-metal released at anode
- Extracting metals — aluminium extracted from molten aluminium oxide by electrolysis (too reactive for carbon reduction)
- Aqueous solutions — more complex: water molecules also present, so hydrogen may be produced at cathode (if metal is more reactive than hydrogen) and oxygen at anode (unless halide ions present, in which case the halogen is produced)
- Half equations (HT) — writing balanced ionic half equations for reactions at each electrode

## Common Misconceptions

- All metals react the same way with acid (students forget that unreactive metals like copper and gold do not react with dilute acid)
- Neutralisation always produces a solution at pH 7 (depends on the strength of the acid and base — a weak acid with a strong base does not give exactly pH 7)
- Electrolysis creates new elements from nothing (the elements were already present as ions in the compound — electrolysis separates them)
- Confusing oxidation and reduction — "oxidation is gaining oxygen" is incomplete at Higher tier, where it must also include electron loss
- The reactivity series is just a list to memorise, with no underlying reason (reactivity relates to how easily a metal loses its outer electrons)
- Thinking any metal can be extracted by heating with carbon (only those less reactive than carbon)

### Q1 — Reactivity series
**Area:** 4.4.1 Reactivity of metals
**Question:** "If you put a piece of zinc into copper sulfate solution, the solution changes colour and a reddish coating appears on the zinc. Explain what's happening and why it wouldn't work the other way round."
**Looking for:** Zinc is more reactive than copper. Zinc displaces copper from the solution — zinc atoms lose electrons and go into solution as zinc ions, while copper ions gain electrons and are deposited as copper metal. It would not work the other way round (copper in zinc sulfate) because copper is less reactive than zinc and cannot displace it.

### Q2 — Acid reactions and neutralisation
**Area:** 4.4.2 Reactions of acids
**Question:** "I add hydrochloric acid to sodium hydroxide solution. Describe what happens, name the products, and explain what 'neutralisation' means."
**Looking for:** Acid + alkali → salt + water. Products are sodium chloride and water. Neutralisation is the reaction between an acid and a base (or alkali) to form a salt and water. The H+ ions from the acid react with the OH- ions from the alkali to form water. The pH moves towards 7.

### Q3 — pH scale
**Area:** 4.4.2 Reactions of acids
**Question:** "Lemon juice has a pH of about 2 and bleach has a pH of about 13. What do those numbers actually tell you, and what would a pH of 7 mean?"
**Looking for:** pH 2 is strongly acidic — high concentration of hydrogen ions (H+). pH 13 is strongly alkaline — low concentration of H+ ions / high concentration of OH- ions. pH 7 is neutral — neither acidic nor alkaline (e.g. pure water). The scale runs from 0 (most acidic) to 14 (most alkaline). Each step on the scale represents a tenfold change in H+ concentration.

### Q4 — Extraction of metals
**Area:** 4.4.1 Reactivity of metals
**Question:** "Iron is extracted from iron ore by heating with carbon in a blast furnace, but aluminium cannot be extracted this way. Predict why aluminium needs a different method and what that method is."
**Looking for:** Aluminium is more reactive than carbon, so carbon cannot reduce aluminium oxide — it is not reactive enough to remove the oxygen. Instead, aluminium is extracted by electrolysis of molten aluminium oxide. Iron is less reactive than carbon, so carbon can reduce iron oxide to iron. The position of the metal relative to carbon in the reactivity series determines the extraction method.

### Q5 — Electrolysis basics
**Area:** 4.4.3 Electrolysis
**Question:** "During the electrolysis of molten lead bromide, lead appears at one electrode and bromine at the other. Explain why the compound has to be molten and which electrode each product forms at."
**Looking for:** Must be molten (or dissolved) so the ions are free to move — in a solid ionic compound, the ions are locked in a lattice and cannot carry charge. Lead (positive Pb2+ ions) moves to the negative electrode (cathode). Bromine (negative Br- ions) moves to the positive electrode (anode). Opposite charges attract — positive ions to negative electrode and vice versa.

### Q6 — Oxidation and reduction
**Area:** 4.4.1 Reactivity of metals
**Question:** "When iron oxide is reduced by carbon in a blast furnace, the iron oxide loses oxygen and the carbon gains it. Explain which substance is oxidised and which is reduced, and what those terms mean."
**Looking for:** Iron oxide is reduced — it loses oxygen (or at Higher tier: the iron ions gain electrons). Carbon is oxidised — it gains oxygen (or at Higher tier: carbon atoms lose electrons). Reduction and oxidation always happen together (redox). Mnemonic: OIL RIG — Oxidation Is Loss (of electrons), Reduction Is Gain. The carbon is the reducing agent because it causes the reduction of iron oxide.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

Use these as conversation starters in guided mode. Adapt and follow up freely.

- "I add hydrochloric acid to a lump of calcium carbonate. What happens, and how would you know when the reaction is finished?"
- "What does a pH number actually tell you? What's happening to the hydrogen ions as you go from pH 1 to pH 14?"
- "Why can we extract iron using a furnace and carbon, but we need electricity for aluminium? What's the key difference?"
- "In electrolysis, positive ions go to the negative electrode. Why? What would happen if you used alternating current instead of direct current?"
- "In a thermite reaction, aluminium reduces iron oxide. Which substance is oxidised and which is reduced — and what do those words actually mean?"
