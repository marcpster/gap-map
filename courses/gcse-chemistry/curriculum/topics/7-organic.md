## Key Concepts

### 4.7.1 Carbon Compounds as Fuels and Feedstock
- Crude oil is a finite resource — a complex mixture of hydrocarbons (compounds of carbon and hydrogen only)
- Fractional distillation separates crude oil into fractions based on boiling point — this is a physical process, not a chemical change
- Properties of hydrocarbon fractions change with chain length: longer chains = higher boiling point, higher viscosity (thicker), less flammable, less volatile
- Shorter chain hydrocarbons are more useful as fuels (lower boiling point, easier to ignite, burn more cleanly)
- Cracking — breaking down longer, less useful hydrocarbons into shorter, more useful ones
- Thermal cracking (high temperature and pressure) and catalytic cracking (high temperature with a catalyst)
- Cracking produces alkanes and alkenes — alkenes are useful for making polymers

### 4.7.2 Reactions of Alkenes and Alcohols (Chemistry Only)
- Alkenes — unsaturated hydrocarbons containing a C=C double bond; general formula CₙH₂ₙ
- Test for alkenes: add bromine water — decolourises from orange/brown to colourless (addition reaction across the double bond)
- Addition reactions of alkenes — hydrogen (hydrogenation), water (hydration to make alcohols), halogens
- Addition polymerisation — many small alkene monomers join to form a long-chain polymer (the double bonds open up)
- Alcohols — contain the –OH functional group; methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol
- Properties of alcohols: dissolve in water, react with sodium to produce hydrogen, burn in air (combustion), used as fuels and solvents
- Alcohols can be oxidised to produce carboxylic acids (e.g. ethanol → ethanoic acid)
- Carboxylic acids — contain the –COOH functional group; they are weak acids (partially ionise in solution), react with carbonates to produce CO₂

### 4.7.3 Synthetic and Naturally Occurring Polymers (Chemistry Only)
- Addition polymerisation — alkene monomers join through opening of double bonds; no other product formed
- Condensation polymerisation (HT) — monomers with two functional groups join; a small molecule (usually water) is released each time a bond forms
- Amino acids (HT) — monomers that form proteins (natural polymers) through condensation polymerisation
- DNA — a natural polymer made of nucleotide monomers
- Other natural polymers: starch, cellulose, proteins
- Synthetic polymers can be designed for specific purposes (e.g. waterproof, flexible, strong)

## Common Misconceptions

- Crude oil is a single substance rather than a mixture of many different hydrocarbons
- Fractional distillation is a chemical change (it's a physical separation — no new substances are made)
- Alkanes and alkenes are the same thing (alkenes have a C=C double bond, alkanes don't)
- All polymers are artificial plastics (many polymers are natural — starch, cellulose, DNA, proteins)
- "Organic" in chemistry means the same as "organic" in food labelling (in chemistry it just means carbon-based compounds)
- Cracking is the same as fractional distillation (cracking is a chemical change that breaks bonds; distillation is physical separation)
- Thinking longer-chain hydrocarbons are "better" fuels (shorter chains are generally more useful as fuels)
- Confusing the bromine water test result — thinking the colour appears rather than disappears

### Q1 — Crude oil and fractional distillation
**Area:** 4.7.1 Carbon compounds as fuels and feedstock
**Question:** "Crude oil is separated into useful fractions in a fractionating column. Explain how the column works and whether this is a chemical or physical process."
**Looking for:** Crude oil is heated and vapours rise up the column. The column is hotter at the bottom and cooler at the top. Hydrocarbons condense at different heights according to their boiling points — shorter chains (lower boiling point) rise higher before condensing, longer chains condense near the bottom. This is a physical process (no chemical bonds broken or formed, no new substances made) — it separates an existing mixture.

### Q2 — Properties related to chain length
**Area:** 4.7.1 Carbon compounds as fuels and feedstock
**Question:** "Petrol has short hydrocarbon chains and bitumen has very long chains. Describe two differences in their physical properties and explain why they're different."
**Looking for:** Petrol: low boiling point, low viscosity (runny), highly flammable. Bitumen: high boiling point, high viscosity (thick/sticky), less flammable. The differences arise because longer chains have stronger intermolecular forces between molecules, so they need more energy to separate (higher boiling point) and flow less easily (higher viscosity).

### Q3 — Cracking and why it's done
**Area:** 4.7.1 Cracking
**Question:** "Oil companies often have more long-chain hydrocarbons than they can sell, but not enough short-chain ones. What process do they use to solve this, and what does it actually do to the molecules?"
**Looking for:** Cracking. It breaks long-chain hydrocarbons into shorter, more useful ones. This is a chemical change — covalent bonds are broken. It produces shorter alkanes (used as fuels) and alkenes (used to make polymers). Methods: thermal cracking (high temperature and pressure) or catalytic cracking (high temperature with a zeolite catalyst).

### Q4 — Alkenes and testing for them
**Area:** 4.7.2 Reactions of alkenes
**Question:** "You're given two colourless liquids — one is an alkane and one is an alkene. Describe a test you could do to tell them apart and explain what you'd see."
**Looking for:** Add bromine water to each. The alkene decolourises the bromine water (turns from orange/brown to colourless) because the C=C double bond reacts with bromine in an addition reaction. The alkane does not react — bromine water stays orange. This works because alkenes are unsaturated (have a double bond that can open up and react).

### Q5 — Alcohols and carboxylic acids
**Area:** 4.7.2 Reactions of alkenes and alcohols
**Question:** "Ethanol is an alcohol and ethanoic acid is a carboxylic acid. What functional group does each one contain, and if I added a small piece of sodium to ethanol, what would you expect to happen?"
**Looking for:** Ethanol contains the –OH (hydroxyl) functional group. Ethanoic acid contains the –COOH (carboxyl) functional group. Sodium reacts with ethanol to produce hydrogen gas (fizzing/effervescence) — similar to sodium in water but less vigorous. Ethanoic acid is a weak acid — it partially ionises in solution, unlike strong acids like HCl.

### Q6 — Polymers
**Area:** 4.7.3 Synthetic and naturally occurring polymers
**Question:** "Poly(ethene) is made from ethene molecules. Explain how lots of small ethene molecules join together to form the polymer, and give me an example of a naturally occurring polymer."
**Looking for:** Addition polymerisation — many ethene monomers join together. The C=C double bond in each ethene molecule opens up, allowing the molecules to link into a long chain. No other product is formed (unlike condensation polymerisation). Natural polymers: starch, cellulose, proteins, DNA. Key distinction: not all polymers are synthetic plastics.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "If crude oil is just a mixture, why do we need to separate it? Why can't we just burn the whole lot as fuel?"
- "Petrol is runny and catches fire easily, but tar is thick and hard to ignite. They both come from crude oil — so why are they so different?"
- "Why do oil companies bother cracking large hydrocarbons? What's wrong with selling them as they are?"
- "I've got two mystery liquids — one alkane, one alkene. How would you figure out which is which using bromine water?"
- "Ethanol is in alcoholic drinks and ethanoic acid is in vinegar. They sound related — are they? How would you get from one to the other?"
- "When ethene molecules polymerise, what happens to the double bond? And can you think of any polymers that aren't made in a factory?"
