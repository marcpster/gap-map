# 8. Chemical Analysis

## Key Concepts

### 4.8.1 Purity, Formulations and Chromatography
- Pure substances in chemistry — a single element or compound, not a mixture (different from everyday meaning of "pure")
- Pure substances have sharp melting and boiling points; mixtures melt/boil over a range
- Formulations — useful mixtures with precise proportions of components, each serving a particular purpose (e.g. paints, medicines, alloys, cleaning products, fuels)
- Chromatography — technique for separating and identifying substances in a mixture
- Mobile phase (solvent) carries substances through the stationary phase (paper or thin-layer plate)
- Rf value = distance moved by substance / distance moved by solvent (measured from the baseline)
- Rf values are unique to a substance under specific conditions — used for identification

### 4.8.2 Identification of Common Gases
- Hydrogen — "squeaky pop" when a burning splint is held near the gas
- Oxygen — relights a glowing splint
- Carbon dioxide — turns limewater milky (cloudy white)
- Chlorine — bleaches damp litmus paper (turns it white)

### 4.8.3 Identification of Ions (Chemistry Only)
- Flame tests for metal ions — lithium (crimson/red), sodium (yellow), potassium (lilac), calcium (orange-red), copper (green)
- Metal hydroxide precipitates — adding sodium hydroxide solution to identify metal ions by precipitate colour (e.g. copper(II) gives blue, iron(II) gives green, iron(III) gives brown)
- Carbonates — add dilute acid, test gas produced with limewater (turns milky = CO2 = carbonate present)
- Halides — add dilute nitric acid then silver nitrate solution (chloride = white precipitate, bromide = cream, iodide = yellow)
- Sulfates — add dilute hydrochloric acid then barium chloride solution (white precipitate = sulfate present)
- Instrumental methods — advantages of machines over chemical tests (sensitive, fast, accurate, can test small samples)
- Flame emission spectroscopy — identifies metals by the wavelengths of light emitted; produces a line spectrum unique to each element

## Common Misconceptions

- "Pure" in everyday language (e.g. "pure orange juice") means the same as "pure" in chemistry — students conflate "natural" or "clean" with chemically pure (a single substance)
- Chromatography only works with inks or dyes — students don't realise it applies to any mixture of soluble substances
- A substance that produces one spot in chromatography must be an element — it could be a single compound
- Flame test colours come from the flame itself rather than from the metal ions being heated
- Precipitate tests identify the whole compound rather than just the specific ion present
- All gases are tested with a burning splint — students forget the limewater test for CO2 and damp litmus for chlorine
- Rf values are always the same regardless of conditions — they depend on the specific solvent and temperature used

### Q1 — Purity in chemistry
**Area:** 4.8.1 Purity, formulations and chromatography
**Question:** "A bottle of water says 'pure spring water' on the label. In chemistry, would we call that a pure substance? Explain your reasoning."
**Looking for:** No — in chemistry, pure means a single element or compound only. Spring water contains dissolved minerals and salts, so it's a mixture. A chemically pure substance has a sharp, fixed melting/boiling point. The everyday meaning of "pure" (natural, clean, nothing harmful added) is different from the chemistry definition.

### Q2 — Chromatography and Rf values
**Area:** 4.8.1 Purity, formulations and chromatography
**Question:** "In a chromatography experiment, the solvent travels 10 cm from the baseline and a substance travels 6 cm. Calculate the Rf value, and explain what it tells you about that substance."
**Looking for:** Rf = distance moved by substance / distance moved by solvent = 6/10 = 0.6. The Rf value can be compared to known values to identify the substance. Each substance has a characteristic Rf under the same conditions (same solvent, same temperature). If a sample produces a single spot, it's likely a pure substance; multiple spots indicate a mixture.

### Q3 — Gas tests
**Area:** 4.8.2 Identification of common gases
**Question:** "You have four test tubes, each containing a different gas: hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and chlorine. Describe how you would identify which is which."
**Looking for:** Hydrogen — hold a burning splint near the mouth, listen for a squeaky pop. Oxygen — hold a glowing splint inside, it relights. Carbon dioxide — bubble through limewater, it turns milky/cloudy. Chlorine — hold damp litmus paper in the gas, it bleaches white. Key: each gas has a specific, distinct test rather than one test for all.

### Q4 — Flame tests
**Area:** 4.8.3 Identification of ions
**Question:** "A scientist dips a wire loop into a sample and holds it in a Bunsen flame. The flame turns lilac. What metal ion is present, and why do different metals produce different coloured flames?"
**Looking for:** Lilac flame = potassium ion. Different metals produce different colours because their electrons absorb energy from the flame and then release it as light of specific wavelengths when they drop back to lower energy levels. Other key colours: lithium = crimson/red, sodium = yellow, calcium = orange-red, copper = green.

### Q5 — Precipitate tests for ions
**Area:** 4.8.3 Identification of ions
**Question:** "Describe how you would test a solution to find out whether it contains chloride ions, bromide ions, or iodide ions."
**Looking for:** Add dilute nitric acid first (to remove any carbonate ions that might interfere), then add silver nitrate solution. Observe the precipitate colour: white = chloride, cream = bromide, yellow = iodide. The test identifies the halide ion specifically — it tells you which halide is present, not the whole compound.

### Q6 — Instrumental methods vs chemical tests
**Area:** 4.8.3 Identification of ions
**Question:** "Modern laboratories often use machines like spectrometers instead of chemical tests like flame tests. What advantages do instrumental methods have over doing the tests by hand?"
**Looking for:** Instrumental methods are more sensitive (can detect very small amounts), more accurate, faster, and can be used to test very small samples. They can identify elements that chemical tests might miss or confuse. Flame emission spectroscopy can distinguish between metals that produce similar flame colours. Machines can also process many samples quickly and produce objective, numerical data rather than relying on human judgement of colours.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

Use these as conversation starters in guided mode. Adapt and follow up freely.

- "If 'pure orange juice' isn't pure in chemistry terms, what would a chemist actually mean by a pure substance?"
- "You run a chromatography experiment and get three spots. What does that tell you about your sample?"
- "I've got a mystery gas — it makes a squeaky pop with a burning splint. What is it, and how would you test for the other common gases?"
- "You dip a loop into a solution and the flame goes green. What metal ion is that? What's actually happening to produce the colour?"
- "A solution gives a cream precipitate when you add silver nitrate. What ion have you found, and what colour would you expect for the other halides?"
- "Why might a forensic lab use a spectrometer rather than doing a flame test by hand?"
