# 1. Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table

## Key Concepts

### 4.1.1 A Simple Model of the Atom
- Atoms, elements and compounds — atoms are the smallest part of an element that can exist
- Mixtures — can be separated by physical methods (filtration, distillation, chromatography, evaporation)
- Development of the atomic model — Dalton's solid spheres, Thomson's plum pudding, Rutherford's nuclear model, Bohr's electron shells, Chadwick's discovery of the neutron
- Subatomic particles — protons (positive, mass 1), neutrons (neutral, mass 1), electrons (negative, negligible mass)
- Size and mass of atoms — radius ~0.1 nm, nucleus ~1/10,000 of atom radius but contains almost all mass
- Relative atomic mass (Ar) — weighted mean of isotope masses relative to carbon-12
- Electronic structure — electrons in shells (2, 8, 8...), determines chemical properties

### 4.1.2 The Periodic Table
- Periodic table organisation — elements arranged by atomic number, periods (rows) and groups (columns)
- Development by Mendeleev — ordered by atomic weight, left gaps for undiscovered elements, swapped order where properties demanded it
- Metals and non-metals — metals on the left and centre, non-metals on the right
- Group 0 noble gases — full outer shells, very unreactive, boiling points increase down the group
- Group 1 alkali metals — one electron in outer shell, increasingly reactive down the group, react with water to produce hydrogen and a metal hydroxide
- Group 7 halogens — seven electrons in outer shell, reactivity decreases down the group, form diatomic molecules, displacement reactions

### 4.1.3 Properties of Transition Metals
- Comparison with Group 1 — higher melting points, higher density, harder, stronger, less reactive
- Typical properties — form coloured compounds, useful as catalysts (e.g. iron in the Haber process), can have ions with different charges

## Common Misconceptions

- Atoms are solid spheres with no internal structure
- Electrons orbit the nucleus like planets round the Sun (fixed paths rather than energy levels/shells)
- Isotopes are different elements rather than different versions of the same element
- Group 1 metals behave like everyday metals (iron, steel) — students expect them to be hard and unreactive
- The periodic table is arranged by mass, not atomic number
- Noble gases have no electrons
- Reactivity increases down the group for all groups (confusing Group 1 and Group 7 trends)

### Q1 — Atomic model and subatomic particles
**Area:** 4.1.1 A simple model of the atom
**Question:** "Describe the structure of an atom. What particles are inside it, and where are they found?"
**Looking for:** Nucleus at the centre containing protons (positive) and neutrons (neutral). Electrons (negative) arranged in shells around the nucleus. Nucleus is tiny compared to the overall size of the atom. Most of the atom is empty space.

### Q2 — Electronic structure
**Area:** 4.1.1 A simple model of the atom
**Question:** "Sodium has 11 electrons. How are those electrons arranged, and why does the arrangement matter for chemistry?"
**Looking for:** Electrons arranged in shells: 2, 8, 1. The outer shell has one electron, which is the electron involved in reactions. Electronic structure determines which group an element belongs to and how it reacts. The one outer electron means sodium is in Group 1.

### Q3 — Periodic table trends
**Area:** 4.1.2 The periodic table
**Question:** "What does it mean when two elements are in the same group of the periodic table? Why do they end up in the same column?"
**Looking for:** Same number of electrons in their outer shell. This gives them similar chemical properties — they react in similar ways. The periodic table is arranged by atomic number, and elements with the same number of outer electrons fall into the same column.

### Q4 — Group 1 alkali metals
**Area:** 4.1.2 The periodic table
**Question:** "Lithium, sodium and potassium are all in Group 1. How do they react with water, and what changes as you go down the group?"
**Looking for:** They react with water to produce hydrogen gas and a metal hydroxide (alkaline solution). Reactivity increases down the group — lithium fizzes gently, sodium fizzes more vigorously and may melt into a ball, potassium reacts violently and the hydrogen ignites with a lilac flame. Outer electron is further from the nucleus and easier to lose as you go down.

### Q5 — Group 7 halogens
**Area:** 4.1.2 The periodic table
**Question:** "Chlorine can displace bromine from a solution of potassium bromide. Why does this happen, and would bromine be able to displace chlorine?"
**Looking for:** Chlorine is more reactive than bromine (higher in Group 7). A more reactive halogen can displace a less reactive one from its compound. Bromine could not displace chlorine because bromine is less reactive. Reactivity decreases down Group 7 because the outer shell is further from the nucleus, making it harder to gain an electron.

### Q6 — Transition metals
**Area:** 4.1.3 Properties of transition metals
**Question:** "How are transition metals different from the metals in Group 1? Give some specific examples of their properties."
**Looking for:** Transition metals are harder, stronger, denser and have much higher melting points than Group 1 metals. They are less reactive. Specific properties include: forming coloured compounds (e.g. copper sulfate is blue), acting as catalysts (e.g. iron in the Haber process), and having ions with different charges (e.g. Fe2+ and Fe3+).

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

Use these as conversation starters in guided mode. Adapt and follow up freely.

- "If you could zoom in on a single atom, what would you see? How has that picture changed over time?"
- "Sodium has 11 electrons — can you draw how they're arranged? What does that tell us about its chemistry?"
- "Why did Mendeleev leave gaps in his periodic table? What was he predicting?"
- "If I drop a piece of potassium into water, what happens and why is it more dramatic than sodium?"
- "Chlorine water is added to potassium bromide solution and the colour changes. What's going on?"
- "Someone says transition metals are 'typical' metals. What do they mean by that, and how do Group 1 metals break the pattern?"
