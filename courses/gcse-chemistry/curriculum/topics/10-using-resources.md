# 10. Using Resources

## Key Concepts

### 4.10.1 Using the Earth's Resources and Obtaining Potable Water
- Natural resources — materials obtained from the Earth's atmosphere, hydrosphere (water) and lithosphere (crust/rocks); some supplemented by agriculture and synthesis
- Sustainable development — meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
- Potable water — water that is safe to drink; not the same as pure water in the chemical sense (potable water contains dissolved substances that are not harmful)
- Treatment of fresh water — sedimentation to remove large particles, filtration through sand beds, then sterilisation (chlorine, ozone or UV light) to kill microorganisms
- Desalination — producing potable water from salty or sea water by distillation or reverse osmosis; energy-intensive and expensive
- Waste water treatment — screening and grit removal, sedimentation to produce sludge, biological treatment (aerobic digestion by microorganisms) to break down organic matter; sludge may be further treated anaerobically to produce biogas

### 4.10.2 Life Cycle Assessment and Recycling
- Life cycle assessment (LCA) — evaluates the environmental impact of a product at every stage: extracting and processing raw materials, manufacturing and packaging, use and operation during its lifetime, disposal at end of life (landfill, recycling, incineration)
- LCAs can be subjective — some environmental impacts are difficult to quantify (e.g. effect on biodiversity, visual pollution)
- Reducing resource use — reduce (use less material), reuse (use again without reprocessing), recycle (reprocess into new products)
- Recycling metals requires less energy than extracting from ores, reduces mining waste and conserves finite ore reserves

### 4.10.3 Using Materials (Chemistry Only)
- Corrosion — the destruction of materials by chemical reactions with substances in the environment; rusting of iron requires both water and oxygen
- Prevention of corrosion — painting, oiling, greasing (barriers to water and oxygen), galvanising (coating with zinc), sacrificial protection (attaching a more reactive metal that corrodes instead)
- Alloys — mixtures of a metal with one or more other elements (usually other metals); atoms of different sizes disrupt the regular lattice, preventing layers from sliding, making alloys harder than pure metals
- Ceramics (e.g. clay, glass) — hard, brittle, good insulators, high melting points
- Polymers — properties depend on the monomers used and conditions of polymerisation; can be designed for specific purposes
- Composites — materials made from two or more different materials combined to give improved properties (e.g. fibreglass, reinforced concrete, carbon fibre)

### 4.10.4 The Haber Process and NPK Fertilisers (Chemistry Only)
- The Haber process — nitrogen (from the air) + hydrogen (from natural gas/methane) ⇌ ammonia: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃
- Conditions — temperature of about 450°C, pressure of about 200 atmospheres, iron catalyst
- Compromise conditions — higher pressure would give more ammonia but is expensive and dangerous; lower temperature would give more ammonia but the reaction would be too slow; 450°C and 200 atm are a compromise between yield and rate
- The reaction is reversible — unreacted nitrogen and hydrogen are recycled back through the reactor
- NPK fertilisers — plants need nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) for healthy growth; fertilisers supply these essential elements
- Ammonia from the Haber process is used to make ammonium nitrate and other nitrogen-based fertilisers

## Common Misconceptions

- Potable water is pure water — students confuse "safe to drink" with "chemically pure" (a single substance with nothing dissolved)
- Recycling has no environmental cost — recycling itself requires energy for collection, transport and reprocessing, though it's generally less than extracting from raw materials
- Rusting is just something that happens over time — students miss that it specifically requires both water and oxygen as a chemical reaction, not just "ageing"
- The Haber process goes to completion — it's a reversible reaction and never reaches 100% conversion; unreacted gases are recycled
- All fertilisers are artificial or harmful — plants need NPK regardless of whether it comes from natural or synthetic sources; the issue is overuse causing pollution (eutrophication)
- Alloys are compounds — they are mixtures of metals, not chemically bonded in fixed ratios
- Life cycle assessments are completely objective — some impacts are difficult to quantify and involve value judgements

### Q1 — Potable water vs pure water
**Area:** 4.10.1 Using the Earth's resources and obtaining potable water
**Question:** "Is the water that comes out of your tap at home pure water in the chemistry sense? Explain what potable water actually is and how it's made safe to drink."
**Looking for:** No — tap water is potable (safe to drink) but not chemically pure. It still contains dissolved minerals and salts. Pure water in chemistry means only water molecules and nothing else. To make potable water: fresh water is passed through sedimentation (to remove large particles), then filtered (e.g. through sand beds), then sterilised (using chlorine, ozone or UV light) to kill microorganisms. Seawater requires desalination (distillation or reverse osmosis), which is much more energy-intensive.

### Q2 — Waste water treatment
**Area:** 4.10.1 Using the Earth's resources and obtaining potable water
**Question:** "When you flush the toilet or pour water down the drain, it goes to a treatment works. Describe the main stages of waste water treatment."
**Looking for:** Screening — removal of large objects (rags, grit, debris). Sedimentation — solids settle out to form sludge. Biological treatment — aerobic bacteria break down dissolved organic matter. The treated water is safe to release back into rivers. The sludge can be further treated anaerobically (without oxygen) to produce useful biogas. Students should understand it's a multi-stage process, not just "cleaning" the water.

### Q3 — Life cycle assessment
**Area:** 4.10.2 Life cycle assessment and recycling
**Question:** "A company wants to work out the total environmental impact of a plastic shopping bag. What stages would they need to consider in a life cycle assessment?"
**Looking for:** Four stages: extracting and processing raw materials (crude oil for plastic), manufacturing and packaging (energy used, waste produced), use during its lifetime (single use vs reusable), disposal at end of life (landfill, incineration, recycling). A strong answer recognises that LCAs look at the entire life span, not just one stage. May also note that some environmental impacts are hard to quantify, making LCAs partly subjective.

### Q4 — Corrosion and rusting
**Area:** 4.10.3 Using materials
**Question:** "Iron gates and railings rust over time but aluminium window frames don't seem to. What conditions are needed for rusting, and how can iron be protected from it?"
**Looking for:** Rusting requires both water and oxygen — if either is absent, iron won't rust. Prevention methods include: barrier methods (painting, oiling, greasing — keep water and oxygen away from the iron), galvanising (coating with zinc), sacrificial protection (attaching a more reactive metal like zinc or magnesium that corrodes preferentially). Aluminium doesn't appear to corrode because it forms a tough, protective oxide layer on its surface. A strong answer explains why each method works, not just names them.

### Q5 — The Haber process
**Area:** 4.10.4 The Haber process and NPK fertilisers
**Question:** "The Haber process makes ammonia. What are the raw materials, what conditions are used, and why are those specific conditions chosen?"
**Looking for:** Nitrogen from the air and hydrogen from natural gas react: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃. Conditions: about 450°C, about 200 atmospheres pressure, iron catalyst. These are compromise conditions — higher pressure would increase yield but is expensive and dangerous; lower temperature would increase yield but the reaction would be too slow; the iron catalyst speeds up the reaction without being used up. The reaction is reversible, so unreacted gases are recycled. Key understanding: the conditions balance economic cost, safety and yield.

### Q6 — Fertilisers and plant growth
**Area:** 4.10.4 The Haber process and NPK fertilisers
**Question:** "Farmers add NPK fertilisers to their fields. What do the letters N, P and K stand for, and why do plants need these elements?"
**Looking for:** N = nitrogen, P = phosphorus, K = potassium. Plants need nitrogen for making proteins and chlorophyll (for growth and photosynthesis), phosphorus for root growth and energy transfer, and potassium for disease resistance and enzyme function. Ammonia from the Haber process is used to make nitrogen fertilisers like ammonium nitrate. Good answers explain why each element matters for plant growth, not just that "plants need them."
