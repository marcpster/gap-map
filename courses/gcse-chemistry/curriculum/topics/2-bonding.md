# 2. Bonding, Structure and Properties of Matter

## Key Concepts

### 4.2.1 Chemical Bonds
- Ionic bonding — metals lose electrons, non-metals gain electrons, forming positive and negative ions held together by electrostatic attraction
- Covalent bonding — non-metals share pairs of electrons to achieve stable electronic structures
- Metallic bonding — regular arrangement of positive metal ions surrounded by a sea of delocalised electrons

### 4.2.2 Properties of Substances
- Three states of matter — solid (fixed shape, fixed volume), liquid (takes shape of container, fixed volume), gas (fills container, no fixed volume); changes of state are physical changes
- Ionic compound properties — high melting and boiling points (strong electrostatic forces), conduct electricity when molten or dissolved (ions free to move), do not conduct when solid (ions fixed in lattice)
- Small molecule properties — low melting and boiling points (weak intermolecular forces), do not conduct electricity (no overall charge/no free electrons)
- Polymers — large molecules made of repeating units, properties depend on intermolecular forces between chains
- Giant covalent structures — diamond (each carbon bonded to four others, very hard, does not conduct), graphite (layers of hexagonal rings, layers slide, conducts — delocalised electrons), silicon dioxide
- Metals and alloys — conduct electricity and heat (delocalised electrons), malleable (layers can slide), alloys are harder than pure metals (different-sized atoms disrupt layers)

### 4.2.3 Structure and Bonding of Carbon
- Diamond — tetrahedral structure, very hard, high melting point, does not conduct electricity
- Graphite — layered structure, weak forces between layers, each carbon bonded to three others with one delocalised electron per atom, conducts electricity
- Graphene — single layer of graphite, strong, light, conducts electricity
- Fullerenes — hollow carbon molecules (e.g. C60 buckminsterfullerene), cage-like structures, can be used for drug delivery and catalysis

### 4.2.4 Nanoparticles
- Sizes — 1-100 nm, between individual atoms and bulk material
- Properties — high surface area to volume ratio gives different properties from bulk material
- Uses — catalysts, coatings, drug delivery, electronics, cosmetics

## Common Misconceptions

- Ionic bonds are weaker than covalent bonds (students confuse bond strength with the brittleness of ionic crystals)
- Metals cannot conduct because they are solid (confusing conduction requirement with state — it is the delocalised electrons that matter)
- Diamond and graphite contain different types of atoms rather than different arrangements of carbon
- NaCl exists as individual molecules rather than a giant ionic lattice
- "Melting ionic compounds breaks the ionic bonds" — at melting point, the lattice structure breaks down but the ions still exist
- Covalent bonds are broken when a molecular substance boils (it is the intermolecular forces that are overcome, not the covalent bonds within molecules)
- Graphite is weak because it is soft (layers slide easily, but the covalent bonds within layers are very strong)

### Q1 — Ionic bonding
**Area:** 4.2.1 Chemical bonds
**Question:** "Sodium chloride is an ionic compound. Describe what happens to the atoms when sodium and chlorine react to form sodium chloride."
**Looking for:** Sodium loses its one outer electron to become a positive ion (Na+). Chlorine gains that electron to become a negative ion (Cl-). The oppositely charged ions are held together by strong electrostatic attraction. This forms a giant ionic lattice, not individual NaCl molecules.

### Q2 — Covalent bonding
**Area:** 4.2.1 Chemical bonds
**Question:** "Water is a covalent compound. What does 'covalent' mean, and why do the atoms bond this way instead of forming ions?"
**Looking for:** Covalent means the atoms share pairs of electrons. Both oxygen and hydrogen are non-metals, so neither can easily lose electrons to form positive ions. By sharing electrons, each atom achieves a stable electronic structure. Oxygen shares two pairs (one with each hydrogen), giving it a full outer shell.

### Q3 — Properties of ionic compounds
**Area:** 4.2.2 Properties of substances
**Question:** "Sodium chloride has a very high melting point and can conduct electricity when dissolved in water, but not when it's solid. Explain why."
**Looking for:** High melting point because the ionic bonds (electrostatic forces between ions) are strong and there are many of them in the lattice — lots of energy needed to overcome them. Conducts when dissolved because the ions are free to move and carry charge. Does not conduct when solid because the ions are held in fixed positions in the lattice and cannot move.

### Q4 — States of matter and molecular properties
**Area:** 4.2.2 Properties of substances
**Question:** "Oxygen gas has a very low boiling point of minus 183 degrees Celsius. Explain why it boils at such a low temperature, even though the bonds inside the oxygen molecule are very strong."
**Looking for:** The covalent bonds within the O2 molecule are strong but that is not what matters for boiling. Boiling involves overcoming the weak intermolecular forces between molecules, not breaking covalent bonds. Because O2 is a small molecule, the intermolecular forces are very weak, so very little energy is needed to separate the molecules.

### Q5 — Giant covalent structures
**Area:** 4.2.2 / 4.2.3 Structure and bonding of carbon
**Question:** "Diamond and graphite are both made entirely of carbon atoms, but diamond is incredibly hard and doesn't conduct electricity while graphite is soft and does conduct. How can the same element have such different properties?"
**Looking for:** Different structures. Diamond: each carbon bonded to four others in a rigid tetrahedral structure — no free electrons, very hard, does not conduct. Graphite: each carbon bonded to three others in layers of hexagons — one delocalised electron per carbon can move and carry charge (conducts), weak forces between layers allow them to slide (soft). Same atoms, different bonding arrangements.

### Q6 — Nanoparticles
**Area:** 4.2.4 Nanoparticles
**Question:** "Nanoparticles are between 1 and 100 nanometres in size. What makes them behave differently from the same material in bulk, and can you think of a use for them?"
**Looking for:** Very high surface area to volume ratio compared to bulk material. This gives them different properties — can be more reactive, have different optical/electrical properties. Uses include: catalysts (high surface area), sun cream (transparent but block UV), drug delivery (small enough to enter cells), coatings, electronics.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

Use these as conversation starters in guided mode. Adapt and follow up freely.

- "If sodium has one outer electron and chlorine has seven, what do you think happens when they meet? Why would that be a stable arrangement?"
- "Water is covalent and sodium chloride is ionic — what is the actual difference in what the atoms are doing?"
- "Salt has a really high melting point but dissolves easily in water. Isn't that a contradiction? What's going on?"
- "If the covalent bonds in oxygen are so strong, why does it boil at minus 183 degrees?"
- "Diamond and graphite are both pure carbon. How can one be see-through and incredibly hard while the other is soft and black?"
- "Why might a nanoparticle of silver behave differently from a lump of silver? What's changed?"
