# 3. Quantitative Chemistry

## Key Concepts

### 4.3.1 Chemical Measurements and Conservation of Mass
- Balanced chemical equations — must have the same number of each type of atom on both sides
- Relative formula mass (Mr) — sum of the relative atomic masses (Ar) of all atoms in the formula
- Conservation of mass — no atoms are created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, so total mass of reactants equals total mass of products
- Mass changes when gases are involved — apparent mass loss when a gas escapes, apparent mass gain when a gas is absorbed (e.g. combustion in an open container)

### 4.3.2 Amount of Substance
- Moles (HT) — one mole of any substance contains 6.02 × 10^23 particles (Avogadro's constant), mass of one mole = Mr in grams
- Amounts in equations (HT) — using balanced equations to calculate masses of reactants and products
- Limiting reactants (HT) — the reactant that is completely used up determines the amount of product formed
- Concentration of solutions — concentration = mass of solute / volume of solution (g/dm3)

### 4.3.3 Yield and Atom Economy
- Percentage yield — (mass of product actually made / maximum theoretical mass) × 100; always less than 100% due to incomplete reactions, practical losses, side reactions
- Atom economy — (Mr of desired product / total Mr of all products) × 100; measures how much of the reactant atoms end up in the useful product

## Common Misconceptions

- Mass is lost during chemical reactions (ignoring gases that escape — students see mass decrease on a balance and conclude matter has been destroyed)
- Confusing relative atomic mass (Ar) with relative formula mass (Mr)
- Thinking percentage yield can exceed 100% (e.g. if the product is wet or impure, the measured mass might be higher, but this is not a genuine yield above 100%)
- Confusing concentration with amount — a small volume of concentrated solution is not the same as a large volume of dilute solution
- Believing that balancing an equation changes the chemicals involved (adjusting formulae rather than just coefficients)
- Thinking atom economy and percentage yield measure the same thing

### Q1 — Conservation of mass
**Area:** 4.3.1 Conservation of mass
**Question:** "When you burn a piece of steel wool on a balance, the mass goes up. When you burn a piece of wood on a balance, the mass goes down. How can both of these be explained by the same rule?"
**Looking for:** Conservation of mass — atoms are not created or destroyed. Steel wool gains mass because it combines with oxygen from the air (the oxygen adds mass). Wood loses mass because the products (carbon dioxide and water vapour) are gases that escape into the air. If you could trap all the gases, the total mass would stay the same in both cases.

### Q2 — Relative formula mass
**Area:** 4.3.1 Relative formula mass
**Question:** "Calculate the relative formula mass of calcium carbonate, CaCO3. The Ar values are: calcium is 40, carbon is 12, oxygen is 16."
**Looking for:** Mr = 40 + 12 + (16 × 3) = 40 + 12 + 48 = 100. Student should add up all the Ar values, remembering to multiply oxygen by 3. Common errors: forgetting to multiply the oxygen, or adding Ar values incorrectly.

### Q3 — Balancing equations
**Area:** 4.3.1 Balanced equations
**Question:** "Methane burns in oxygen to produce carbon dioxide and water. The unbalanced equation is CH4 + O2 gives CO2 + H2O. How would you balance it, and why does it need balancing?"
**Looking for:** Balanced equation: CH4 + 2O2 → CO2 + 2H2O. Needs balancing because the number of each type of atom must be the same on both sides — this reflects conservation of mass. Student should adjust coefficients (numbers in front), not change the chemical formulae themselves.

### Q4 — Concentration of solutions
**Area:** 4.3.2 Concentration of solutions
**Question:** "I dissolve 10 grams of salt in water to make 500 cubic centimetres of solution. Calculate the concentration in grams per decimetre cubed."
**Looking for:** Concentration = mass / volume. Must convert 500 cm3 to 0.5 dm3 first. Concentration = 10 / 0.5 = 20 g/dm3. Key step is the unit conversion — 1 dm3 = 1000 cm3.

### Q5 — Percentage yield
**Area:** 4.3.3 Percentage yield
**Question:** "In an experiment, the maximum theoretical mass of copper you could make is 6.4 grams, but you only managed to collect 4.8 grams. What is the percentage yield, and why might it be less than 100 percent?"
**Looking for:** Percentage yield = (4.8 / 6.4) × 100 = 75%. Less than 100% because: some product may be lost during transfer or filtering, the reaction may not have gone to completion, or there may have been side reactions producing unwanted products. Yield can never genuinely exceed 100%.

### Q6 — Atom economy
**Area:** 4.3.3 Atom economy
**Question:** "A reaction produces the useful product you want, but it also produces a waste by-product. Why might a company care about the atom economy of the reaction, not just the yield?"
**Looking for:** Atom economy measures how much of the starting materials end up as useful product versus waste. High atom economy means less waste, which is better for the environment and more cost-effective. A reaction could have high yield but low atom economy if it reliably makes lots of product but also lots of waste. Companies want both high yield and high atom economy to reduce costs and environmental impact.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

Use these as conversation starters in guided mode. Adapt and follow up freely.

- "If I burn magnesium ribbon on a balance, would you expect the mass to go up, go down, or stay the same? Why?"
- "What's the relative formula mass of H2SO4? Walk me through how you'd work that out."
- "When you balance an equation, what are you actually allowed to change and what must you leave alone?"
- "I've got a concentrated solution and a dilute solution of the same stuff — what's actually different about them?"
- "Your experiment made 4.8g of product but the theory says you should have got 6.4g. What went wrong? How would you calculate what fraction you actually got?"
- "Two factories make the same chemical, but one process produces a by-product and the other doesn't. Why does that matter?"
