# 5. Energy Changes

## Key Concepts

### 4.5.1 Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions
- Energy transfer during chemical reactions — energy is conserved, not created or destroyed
- Exothermic reactions transfer energy to the surroundings (temperature increase) — combustion, neutralisation, oxidation
- Endothermic reactions take in energy from the surroundings (temperature decrease) — thermal decomposition, citric acid + sodium hydrogencarbonate
- Reaction profiles — show relative energy of reactants and products, activation energy as the energy barrier
- Exothermic: products lower energy than reactants; endothermic: products higher energy than reactants
- Bond energy calculations (HT) — energy in = bonds broken, energy out = bonds formed; overall energy change = sum of bonds broken − sum of bonds formed

### 4.5.2 Chemical Cells and Fuel Cells (Chemistry Only)
- Chemical cells — two different metals in an electrolyte produce a potential difference (voltage)
- The greater the difference in reactivity of the two metals, the greater the voltage
- Batteries — two or more cells connected in series
- Fuel cells — react a fuel (e.g. hydrogen) with oxygen to produce a voltage; hydrogen fuel cell produces only water as a by-product
- Advantages of fuel cells — no pollutant gases, high efficiency, continuous supply of fuel
- Disadvantages — hydrogen is difficult to store, most hydrogen is currently produced from fossil fuels, expensive to manufacture
- Comparison with rechargeable batteries — fuel cells don't need recharging but need constant fuel supply

## Common Misconceptions

- Endothermic reactions are "cold" rather than understanding they absorb energy from surroundings
- Energy is created in exothermic reactions rather than being released from chemical bonds
- All reactions need continuous heating to keep going (confusing activation energy with ongoing energy input)
- Fuel cells "use up" hydrogen permanently rather than understanding it's converted to water
- Confusing temperature change with total energy change (a small temperature change in a large volume can involve more energy than a large change in a small volume)
- Thinking bond breaking releases energy (it requires energy — only bond forming releases energy)
- Believing a higher activation energy means a more exothermic reaction (no relationship)
- Assuming all batteries contain the same metals

### Q1 — Exothermic vs endothermic
**Area:** 4.5.1 Exothermic and endothermic reactions
**Question:** "When you hold a hand warmer, it gets hot. When you hold a cold pack for a sports injury, it gets cold. Explain what's happening in terms of energy transfer in each one."
**Looking for:** Hand warmer — exothermic reaction, energy transferred from the chemicals to the surroundings (your hand), temperature increases. Cold pack — endothermic reaction, energy absorbed from surroundings into the chemicals, temperature decreases. Key: the energy isn't created or destroyed, it's transferred.

### Q2 — Reaction profiles
**Area:** 4.5.1 Reaction profiles and activation energy
**Question:** "If I drew a reaction profile for an exothermic reaction, where would the products be compared to the reactants — higher or lower? And what does the 'hump' in the middle represent?"
**Looking for:** Products are lower than reactants on the energy axis (energy has been released to surroundings). The hump represents the activation energy — the minimum energy needed for the reaction to start. Even exothermic reactions need this initial energy input to break bonds and get going.

### Q3 — Energy transfer in everyday reactions
**Area:** 4.5.1 Exothermic and endothermic reactions
**Question:** "Give me one example of an exothermic reaction and one example of an endothermic reaction that you might come across in everyday life. Explain how you'd know which is which."
**Looking for:** Exothermic examples: combustion (burning fuel), neutralisation (acid + alkali), rusting/oxidation. Endothermic examples: thermal decomposition (cooking breaks down compounds), dissolving citric acid in water. How to tell: exothermic — surroundings get hotter; endothermic — surroundings get cooler.

### Q4 — Bond energy concept
**Area:** 4.5.1 Bond energy
**Question:** "During a chemical reaction, bonds in the reactants are broken and new bonds in the products are formed. Which of those two processes — breaking bonds or forming bonds — releases energy?"
**Looking for:** Forming bonds releases energy (exothermic process). Breaking bonds requires energy (endothermic process). If more energy is released forming new bonds than is needed to break old bonds, the overall reaction is exothermic. This is a very commonly confused point — many students think breaking bonds releases energy.

### Q5 — Chemical cells and batteries
**Area:** 4.5.2 Chemical cells and batteries
**Question:** "In a simple chemical cell, you put two different metals into an electrolyte and get a voltage. What would happen to the voltage if you used two pieces of the same metal instead?"
**Looking for:** No voltage (zero potential difference). The voltage depends on the difference in reactivity between the two metals. Same metal = no difference in reactivity = no voltage. The greater the difference in reactivity, the greater the voltage produced.

### Q6 — Fuel cells
**Area:** 4.5.2 Fuel cells
**Question:** "A hydrogen fuel cell is sometimes described as a 'clean' energy source. What does it produce when it runs, and why might someone argue it's not entirely clean?"
**Looking for:** Produces water (and electricity) — no pollutant gases at point of use, which is why it's called clean. However: the hydrogen itself is often produced from fossil fuels (steam reforming of methane), hydrogen is difficult to store safely, and manufacturing the fuel cells requires energy and resources. So the full life cycle isn't necessarily clean.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "If I mix an acid and an alkali and the test tube gets warm, is that exothermic or endothermic? How do you know?"
- "A reaction needs a spark to get it going, but then it releases loads of heat. Does needing a spark make it endothermic?"
- "In bond energy calculations, students often get the sign wrong. Can you talk me through which requires energy — breaking bonds or forming them?"
- "If I told you a reaction profile showed the products much higher than the reactants, what would that tell you about the reaction?"
- "Why do you get a bigger voltage from a zinc-copper cell than from a zinc-iron cell?"
- "Someone says hydrogen fuel cells are perfect because they only produce water. What's the catch?"
