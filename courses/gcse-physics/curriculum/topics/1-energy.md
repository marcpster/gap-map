# 1. Energy

## Key Concepts

### 1.1 Energy Changes in a System
- Energy stores: kinetic, gravitational potential, elastic potential, thermal, chemical, magnetic, electrostatic, nuclear
- Energy transfers: mechanically, electrically, by heating, by radiation
- Changes in energy stores (e.g. object projected upwards — kinetic store decreases, gravitational potential store increases)
- Specific heat capacity
- Work done and energy transfer (W = Fs)
- Kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²)
- Gravitational potential energy (GPE = mgh)
- Elastic potential energy (EPE = ½ke²)

### 1.2 Conservation and Dissipation
- Energy cannot be created or destroyed — only transferred
- Dissipation — energy becoming spread out and less useful
- Efficiency = useful output / total input
- Ways to reduce unwanted energy transfers (lubrication, insulation)

### 1.3 National and Global Energy Resources
- Renewable vs non-renewable
- Uses: transport, electricity generation, heating
- Environmental impact and reliability of different sources

## Common Misconceptions

- Energy is "used up" or "lost" rather than transferred/dissipated
- Confusing energy stores with energy transfers
- Thinking heavier objects fall faster (conflating with energy concepts)
- Believing efficiency can exceed 100%
- Confusing temperature and thermal energy
- Thinking renewable means "free" or "zero impact"

### Q1 — Energy stores
**Area:** 1.1 Energy changes
**Question:** "If I lift a ball up and hold it still above my head, where has the energy gone? What kind of energy does it have now?"
**Looking for:** Gravitational potential energy store. Transfer from chemical (muscles) to gravitational potential.

### Q2 — Conservation of energy
**Area:** 1.2 Conservation and dissipation
**Question:** "When you rub your hands together, they get warm. Where has that energy come from and where has it gone?"
**Looking for:** Chemical energy in muscles transferred to thermal energy by friction. Energy isn't created — it's transferred.

### Q3 — Efficiency
**Area:** 1.2 Conservation and dissipation
**Question:** "A kettle is 90% efficient. What does that actually mean? Where does the other 10% go?"
**Looking for:** 90% of electrical energy transferred usefully to thermal energy of water. 10% dissipated to surroundings (sound, heating the kettle body, etc). Not "lost".

### Q4 — Energy stores vs transfers
**Area:** 1.1 Energy changes
**Question:** "Can you name some different ways that energy can be stored?"
**Looking for:** Can they list several stores (kinetic, thermal, chemical, gravitational potential, elastic, magnetic, electrostatic, nuclear)? Do they confuse stores with transfers?

### Q5 — Perpetual motion
**Area:** 1.2 Conservation and dissipation
**Question:** "Why can't we build a machine that runs forever without any fuel or power source?"
**Looking for:** Energy dissipation — every transfer wastes some energy to surroundings (friction, sound, heat). Eventually all useful energy is dissipated.

### Q6 — Energy resources
**Area:** 1.3 Energy resources
**Question:** "Solar panels are renewable energy. Does that mean they have no environmental impact at all?"
**Looking for:** Understanding that renewable ≠ zero impact. Manufacturing, materials, land use, disposal all have environmental costs. Renewable means the source won't run out.
