# 4. Atomic Structure

## Key Concepts

### 4.1 Atoms and Isotopes
- Structure: protons, neutrons, electrons
- Atomic number and mass number
- Isotopes — same protons, different neutrons
- Size of atom vs size of nucleus (atom is mostly empty space)
- Development of the atomic model (Dalton → Thomson → Rutherford → Bohr → Chadwick)

### 4.2 Atoms and Nuclear Radiation
- Radioactive decay is random and spontaneous
- Alpha (α): 2 protons + 2 neutrons, stopped by paper, highly ionising
- Beta (β): high-speed electron from nucleus, stopped by aluminium, moderately ionising
- Gamma (γ): electromagnetic wave, reduced by thick lead/concrete, weakly ionising
- Half-life — time for count rate or number of unstable nuclei to halve
- Nuclear equations for decay

### 4.3 Hazards and Uses
- Contamination vs irradiation — key distinction
- Medical uses: tracers (gamma), cancer treatment
- Dangers depend on type of radiation and whether source is inside or outside body

### 4.4 Nuclear Fission and Fusion
- Fission: splitting heavy nuclei (uranium/plutonium), chain reaction
- Fusion: joining light nuclei (hydrogen), requires extreme temperature/pressure
- Where each occurs (fission in reactors, fusion in stars)

## Common Misconceptions

- Radioactive materials glow green
- All radiation is dangerous/deadly
- Radioactive decay can be sped up or stopped
- Confusing contamination and irradiation
- Thinking electrons orbit in neat circles (planetary model is outdated)
- Confusing fission and fusion
- Half-life means "half of it is gone forever"

### Q1 — Atomic structure
**Area:** 4.1 Atoms and isotopes
**Question:** "What's inside an atom? Can you describe its structure?"
**Looking for:** Nucleus (protons + neutrons) in the centre, electrons orbiting/in shells around it. Nucleus is tiny compared to the atom. Mostly empty space.

### Q2 — Isotopes
**Area:** 4.1 Atoms and isotopes
**Question:** "What's the difference between an atom with 6 protons and 6 neutrons, and an atom with 6 protons and 8 neutrons?"
**Looking for:** Both are carbon (same element — same number of protons). Different mass numbers. They're isotopes. The second is carbon-14.

### Q3 — Half-life
**Area:** 4.2 Nuclear radiation
**Question:** "If I start with 1000 unstable atoms and the half-life is 2 hours, roughly how many unstable atoms are left after 6 hours?"
**Looking for:** 125. After 2 hours: 500. After 4 hours: 250. After 6 hours: 125. Three half-lives. Understanding that half-life is about the proportion remaining, not a fixed number.

### Q4 — Contamination vs irradiation
**Area:** 4.3 Hazards and uses
**Question:** "What's the difference between contamination and irradiation? Which one is more of a long-term worry?"
**Looking for:** Irradiation = exposed to radiation from a source (source stays outside). Contamination = radioactive material gets on or inside you. Contamination is more dangerous long-term because the source stays with you, continuously irradiating.

### Q5 — Alpha inside vs outside
**Area:** 4.3 Hazards and uses
**Question:** "Why is an alpha source more dangerous inside the body but less dangerous outside the body?"
**Looking for:** Alpha is highly ionising but stopped by skin/paper. Outside: can't penetrate skin, low risk. Inside: all that ionising energy is absorbed by cells, causing serious damage.

### Q6 — Fission vs fusion
**Area:** 4.4 Fission and fusion
**Question:** "What's the difference between nuclear fission and nuclear fusion? Where does each one happen?"
**Looking for:** Fission = splitting heavy nuclei (uranium), happens in nuclear power stations. Fusion = joining light nuclei (hydrogen), happens in stars. Fusion requires extreme temperature and pressure.
