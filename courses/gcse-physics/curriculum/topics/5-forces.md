# 5. Forces

## Key Concepts

### 5.1 Forces and Their Interactions
- Scalar vs vector quantities
- Contact forces (friction, air resistance, tension, normal contact) vs non-contact forces (gravity, electrostatic, magnetic)
- Weight vs mass (W = mg)
- Resultant forces
- Free body diagrams

### 5.2 Work Done and Energy Transfer
- Work done = force × distance (W = Fs)
- Work done against friction causes temperature increase
- Energy transfer through work

### 5.3 Forces and Elasticity
- Extension proportional to force (Hooke's law) up to the limit of proportionality
- Spring constant (F = ke)
- Elastic vs inelastic deformation

### 5.4 Moments, Levers and Gears
- Moment = force × distance from pivot (M = Fd)
- Principle of moments (balanced when clockwise = anticlockwise)
- Levers and gears as force multipliers

### 5.5 Pressure in Fluids
- Pressure = force / area (p = F/A)
- Pressure in liquids increases with depth (p = hρg)
- Atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude
- Upthrust

### 5.6 Motion
- Speed, distance, time (s = vt)
- Distance-time graphs (gradient = speed)
- Velocity-time graphs (gradient = acceleration, area = distance)
- Acceleration (a = Δv/t)
- Newton's First Law: object stays at rest or constant velocity unless acted on by resultant force
- Newton's Second Law: F = ma
- Newton's Third Law: equal and opposite forces on different objects
- Terminal velocity
- Stopping distance = thinking distance + braking distance

### 5.7 Momentum (Higher)
- Momentum = mass × velocity (p = mv)
- Conservation of momentum in collisions
- Force = rate of change of momentum

## Common Misconceptions

- Heavier objects fall faster
- An object moving at constant speed has no forces acting on it (rather than balanced forces)
- Newton's Third Law pairs act on the same object
- Confusing mass and weight
- Thinking "no resultant force" means "no forces at all"
- Velocity and speed are the same thing
- A stationary object has no forces on it

### Q1 — Mass vs weight
**Area:** 5.1 Forces and their interactions
**Question:** "What's the difference between mass and weight? Would either of them change if you went to the Moon?"
**Looking for:** Mass = amount of matter, measured in kg, stays the same everywhere. Weight = force of gravity on an object, measured in N, would be less on the Moon (weaker gravitational field).

### Q2 — Balanced forces
**Area:** 5.6 Motion / Newton's First Law
**Question:** "A car is driving at a steady 30mph on a straight road. What's the overall resultant force on the car?"
**Looking for:** Zero. Constant speed in a straight line = balanced forces. Driving force equals resistive forces (friction, air resistance). Not "no forces" — balanced forces.

### Q3 — Newton's Third Law
**Area:** 5.6 Motion
**Question:** "I push against a wall and it doesn't move. Is the wall pushing back on me?"
**Looking for:** Yes — equal and opposite force (Newton's Third Law). The two forces act on different objects (me and the wall). That's why I don't accelerate through the wall.

### Q4 — Terminal velocity
**Area:** 5.6 Motion
**Question:** "When a skydiver jumps out of a plane, they speed up at first but then eventually fall at a constant speed. Why do they stop accelerating?"
**Looking for:** Air resistance increases as speed increases. Eventually air resistance equals weight. Resultant force becomes zero. No acceleration — constant speed (terminal velocity).

### Q5 — F = ma application
**Area:** 5.6 Motion / Newton's Second Law
**Question:** "A 1000kg car accelerates at 2 metres per second squared. Calculate the force needed to produce that acceleration."
**Looking for:** F = ma = 1000 × 2 = 2000N. Bonus: recognises this assumes no friction/air resistance, so actual engine force would need to be greater.

### Q6 — Moments
**Area:** 5.4 Moments
**Question:** "Two children are on a seesaw and one is heavier than the other. Without anyone getting off or adding any weight, how could they balance it?"
**Looking for:** Heavier child sits closer to the pivot. Moment = force × distance. For balance, clockwise moment = anticlockwise moment. Reducing distance compensates for greater weight.

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "If I drop a feather and a hammer on the Moon (no air), which hits first? Why is Earth different?"
- "A car is driving at a steady 30mph on a straight road. What's the resultant force? Why?"
- "What's the difference between mass and weight? Would your weight change on the Moon?"
- "I push a wall and it doesn't move. Is the wall pushing back? How do you know?"
- "Why does a parachutist eventually fall at a constant speed?"
- "A 1000kg car accelerates at 2 m/s². What force is the engine providing? What assumptions are you making?"
