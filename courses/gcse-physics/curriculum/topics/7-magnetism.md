# 7. Magnetism and Electromagnetism

## Key Concepts

### 7.1 Permanent and Induced Magnetism
- Magnetic poles — attract and repel
- Magnetic fields — direction (north to south outside magnet)
- Permanent magnets vs induced magnets
- Electromagnets — can be switched on/off, strength controlled by current/coils/core
- Magnetic field around a straight wire (concentric circles)
- Magnetic field of a solenoid (similar to bar magnet)
- Compass and plotting field lines

### 7.2 The Motor Effect
- A current-carrying wire in a magnetic field experiences a force
- Fleming's left-hand rule: thuMb = Motion, First finger = Field, seCond finger = Current
- Force depends on: magnetic flux density, current, length of wire (F = BIl)
- Electric motors — coil rotates due to motor effect
- Loudspeakers — varying current in coil causes cone to vibrate

### 7.3 Induced Potential (Higher)
- Moving a wire through a magnetic field induces a potential difference
- Changing magnetic field through a coil induces a potential difference
- Factors affecting size: speed of movement, field strength, number of turns
- Generators — rotating coil in magnetic field produces AC
- Transformers — changing current in primary coil induces voltage in secondary
- Transformer equation: Vp/Vs = np/ns

## Common Misconceptions

- Magnets attract all metals (only ferromagnetic: iron, nickel, cobalt, steel)
- The north pole of a compass points to Earth's geographic north (it points to Earth's magnetic north, which is near geographic north)
- Confusing magnetic and electric fields
- Thinking motors and generators work on the same principle in the same way (related but reversed)
- Electromagnets are permanent
- Transformers work with DC (they require changing/alternating current)

### Q1 — Magnetic materials
**Area:** 7.1 Magnetism
**Question:** "A magnet attracts a steel paperclip but doesn't attract an aluminium drinks can. Why not? They're both metals."
**Looking for:** Only certain metals are magnetic (ferromagnetic) — iron, nickel, cobalt, steel. Aluminium isn't ferromagnetic. Not all metals are attracted to magnets.

### Q2 — Electromagnets vs permanent magnets
**Area:** 7.1 Magnetism
**Question:** "How is an electromagnet different from a permanent magnet? When would you choose to use an electromagnet instead?"
**Looking for:** Electromagnet can be switched on/off, strength can be varied (change current, number of coils, add iron core). Permanent magnet is always on. Use electromagnet when you need to control it — e.g. scrapyard crane, circuit breaker.

### Q3 — Fleming's left-hand rule
**Area:** 7.2 Motor effect
**Question:** "What does Fleming's left-hand rule tell you, and when would you use it?"
**Looking for:** Predicts the direction of force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field. Thumb = motion/force, first finger = field direction, second finger = current direction. Used for motors.

### Q4 — How a motor works
**Area:** 7.2 Motor effect
**Question:** "Can you explain how a simple electric motor works? What makes it spin?"
**Looking for:** Current-carrying coil in a magnetic field. Motor effect produces force on each side of the coil. Forces are in opposite directions (because current flows in opposite directions on each side). This creates rotation. Commutator reverses current every half turn to keep it spinning.

### Q5 — Transformers and DC
**Area:** 7.3 Induced potential (Higher)
**Question:** "Transformers are used in the National Grid to change voltages. Why do they only work with AC and not DC?"
**Looking for:** Transformers work by electromagnetic induction — a changing magnetic field induces a voltage in the secondary coil. AC produces a constantly changing magnetic field. DC produces a constant field — no change, no induction.

### Q6 — Electromagnetic induction
**Area:** 7.3 Induced potential (Higher)
**Question:** "If I move a wire quickly through a magnetic field, what happens? What if I move it faster?"
**Looking for:** A potential difference (voltage) is induced across the wire. Moving faster = greater rate of change of magnetic flux = larger induced voltage. This is electromagnetic induction.
