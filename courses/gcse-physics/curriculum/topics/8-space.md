# 8. Space Physics

## Key Concepts

### 8.1 Solar System and Orbits
- Solar system: Sun, planets, dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, comets
- Orbits — gravity provides the centripetal force
- Circular orbits: speed and radius are related (closer = faster)
- Satellites: natural (moons) and artificial
- Our Sun as a star, Milky Way as our galaxy
- Scale: planet < star < galaxy < universe

### 8.2 Red-shift
- Light from distant galaxies is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum
- Further away = greater red-shift = moving away faster
- This is evidence the universe is expanding
- Big Bang theory — universe began from a very small, hot, dense point
- Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) — further evidence for Big Bang

## Common Misconceptions

- The Sun orbits the Earth
- Seasons are caused by Earth being closer/further from the Sun (they're caused by axial tilt)
- Stars and planets are the same size
- The Big Bang was an explosion in space (it was the expansion of space itself)
- Red-shift means objects are literally turning red
- Space is completely empty between objects
- Gravity only exists on Earth or near planets

### Q1 — Orbital speed
**Area:** 8.1 Solar system and orbits
**Question:** "Mercury orbits much faster than Neptune. Why do planets closer to the Sun orbit faster?"
**Looking for:** Stronger gravitational pull closer to the Sun. Greater force means greater centripetal acceleration. Need to move faster to maintain a stable orbit at a closer distance.

### Q2 — Seasons
**Area:** 8.1 Solar system and orbits
**Question:** "What causes the seasons? Why is it summer in the UK when it's winter in Australia?"
**Looking for:** Earth's axis is tilted. When the Northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, it gets more direct sunlight and longer days = summer. Southern hemisphere tilted away = winter there. NOT caused by distance from the Sun.

### Q3 — Red-shift
**Area:** 8.2 Red-shift
**Question:** "If I look at light from a distant galaxy and it's been red-shifted, what does that tell me about that galaxy?"
**Looking for:** The galaxy is moving away from us. Light waves stretched (longer wavelength) because the source is moving away. Further galaxies = greater red-shift = moving away faster.

### Q4 — Evidence for the Big Bang
**Area:** 8.2 Red-shift
**Question:** "What's the evidence that the universe started with a Big Bang?"
**Looking for:** Two main pieces: (1) Red-shift — galaxies are all moving apart, universe is expanding, so it must have been smaller/denser in the past. (2) Cosmic microwave background radiation — leftover thermal radiation from the early universe, detected in all directions.

### Q5 — Star vs planet
**Area:** 8.1 Solar system
**Question:** "What's the difference between a star and a planet?"
**Looking for:** Stars produce their own light/energy through nuclear fusion. Planets don't — they reflect light from their star. Stars are much larger. Planets orbit stars.

### Q6 — Scale of the universe
**Area:** 8.1 Solar system
**Question:** "Can you put these in order of size, smallest to largest: galaxy, planet, star, universe?"
**Looking for:** Planet < star < galaxy < universe. Our solar system is in the Milky Way galaxy. The universe contains billions of galaxies.
