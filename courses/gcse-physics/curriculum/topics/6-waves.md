# 6. Waves

## Key Concepts

### 6.1 Waves in Air, Fluids and Solids
- Transverse vs longitudinal waves
- Amplitude, wavelength, frequency, period
- Wave speed (v = fλ)
- Reflection, refraction, diffraction
- Sound waves — longitudinal, need a medium, cannot travel through vacuum
- Measuring speed of sound and speed of waves on water

### 6.2 Electromagnetic Waves
- EM spectrum: radio, microwave, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, gamma
- All EM waves travel at same speed in vacuum (3 × 10⁸ m/s)
- All are transverse
- Uses and dangers of each type
- Refraction of light — change of speed causes change of direction
- Reflection — law of reflection (angle of incidence = angle of reflection)

### 6.3 Black Body Radiation
- All objects emit and absorb infrared radiation
- Hotter objects emit more infrared and at higher frequencies
- A perfect black body absorbs all radiation
- Earth's temperature — balance between absorbed and emitted radiation

## Common Misconceptions

- Sound can travel through space/vacuum
- Light is the fastest thing and nothing else travels at that speed (all EM waves do)
- Waves carry matter from one place to another (they carry energy, not matter)
- Higher frequency means faster wave (frequency and speed are independent for a given medium)
- Thinking only visible light is an electromagnetic wave
- UV, X-rays, gamma are "different things" rather than part of the same spectrum
- Confusing transverse and longitudinal

### Q1 — Transverse vs longitudinal
**Area:** 6.1 Waves in air, fluids and solids
**Question:** "What's the difference between a transverse wave and a longitudinal wave? Can you give me an example of each?"
**Looking for:** Transverse: oscillations perpendicular to direction of travel (e.g. light, water waves). Longitudinal: oscillations parallel to direction of travel (e.g. sound). Compressions and rarefactions in longitudinal.

### Q2 — Sound in a vacuum
**Area:** 6.1 Waves in air, fluids and solids
**Question:** "Why can't astronauts hear each other in space without using radios?"
**Looking for:** Sound needs a medium (particles) to travel through. Space is a vacuum — no particles to vibrate. Radio waves are EM waves which don't need a medium.

### Q3 — EM spectrum commonality
**Area:** 6.2 Electromagnetic waves
**Question:** "Radio waves and gamma rays seem very different. What do they actually have in common?"
**Looking for:** Both are electromagnetic waves. Both travel at the speed of light in a vacuum. Both are transverse. Same nature, just different frequencies/wavelengths.

### Q4 — Refraction
**Area:** 6.2 Electromagnetic waves
**Question:** "When light goes from air into glass, it changes direction. Why does it bend?"
**Looking for:** Light slows down in glass (denser medium). The change in speed causes the change in direction. Bends toward the normal when slowing down.

### Q5 — Frequency and speed
**Area:** 6.1 Waves
**Question:** "If I increase the frequency of a sound wave, does the sound travel faster?"
**Looking for:** No. Speed of sound depends on the medium, not the frequency. Higher frequency = higher pitch, but same speed in the same medium. v = fλ, so if f increases, λ decreases.

### Q6 — What waves transfer
**Area:** 6.1 Waves
**Question:** "When a wave travels across water, does the water itself move from one side to the other?"
**Looking for:** No. The water moves up and down (oscillates) but doesn't travel with the wave. Waves transfer energy, not matter. A floating duck bobs up and down but doesn't travel with the wave.
