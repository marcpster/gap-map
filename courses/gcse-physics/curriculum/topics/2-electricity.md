# 2. Electricity

## Key Concepts

### 2.1 Current, Potential Difference and Resistance
- Charge flow (Q = It)
- Current as rate of charge flow
- Potential difference as energy per unit charge (V = W/Q)
- Resistance (V = IR)
- IV characteristics of resistors, filament lamps, diodes, LDRs, thermistors

### 2.2 Series and Parallel Circuits
- Current same throughout series circuit
- Current splits in parallel circuit
- Potential difference shared in series, same across parallel branches
- Total resistance in series (adds up)
- Total resistance in parallel (decreases)

### 2.3 Domestic Uses and Safety
- Direct vs alternating current
- UK mains: 230V, 50Hz
- Live, neutral, earth wires — what each does
- Fuses and circuit breakers

### 2.4 Energy Transfers
- Power (P = IV, P = I²R)
- Energy transferred (E = Pt, E = QV)
- National Grid — step-up and step-down transformers, why high voltage for transmission

### 2.5 Static Electricity
- Charging by friction — electron transfer
- Like charges repel, unlike attract
- Electric fields

## Common Misconceptions

- Current is "used up" as it goes around a circuit
- Confusing current and voltage ("voltage flows")
- Thinking batteries store current
- Believing the earth wire carries current during normal operation
- Thinking parallel circuits share current equally regardless of resistance
- Confusing power and energy

### Q1 — What is current
**Area:** 2.1 Current, potential difference and resistance
**Question:** "What's actually moving through a wire when current flows in a circuit?"
**Looking for:** Electrons (charge carriers). Flow of charge. Not "electricity" or "energy" flowing.

### Q2 — Series circuits
**Area:** 2.2 Series and parallel circuits
**Question:** "If I have two bulbs in a series circuit and I add a third bulb, what happens to the brightness of the first two? Why?"
**Looking for:** They get dimmer. Same current flows through all, but total resistance increases so current decreases. Voltage is shared between more components.

### Q3 — Current in circuits
**Area:** 2.2 Series and parallel circuits
**Question:** "Does the current get used up as it goes around a circuit, or does the same amount come back to the battery?"
**Looking for:** Same amount comes back. Current is conserved. Charge flows in a complete loop. Energy is transferred, not current.

### Q4 — Earth wire
**Area:** 2.3 Domestic uses and safety
**Question:** "What does the earth wire do in a plug, and when does it actually do anything?"
**Looking for:** Safety wire. Only carries current if there's a fault (live wire touches metal casing). Provides low-resistance path to earth, causing large current that blows the fuse.

### Q5 — National Grid
**Area:** 2.4 Energy transfers
**Question:** "Why do we transmit electricity at really high voltages across the National Grid instead of just using the normal 230V?"
**Looking for:** High voltage means lower current for same power (P = IV). Lower current means less energy wasted as heat in the cables (P = I²R). Step-up transformers increase voltage, step-down transformers reduce it for homes.

### Q6 — Static electricity
**Area:** 2.5 Static electricity
**Question:** "If you rub a balloon on your jumper and stick it to the wall, what's actually happened? What's moved?"
**Looking for:** Electrons transferred from jumper to balloon (or vice versa). Balloon becomes negatively charged. Induces charge on wall surface. Attraction between opposite charges holds it up.
