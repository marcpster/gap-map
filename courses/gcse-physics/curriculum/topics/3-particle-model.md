# 3. Particle Model of Matter

## Key Concepts

### 3.1 Changes of State and the Particle Model
- Solids, liquids, gases — particle arrangement and movement
- Changes of state: melting, freezing, boiling, evaporation, condensation, sublimation
- Changes of state are physical (reversible), not chemical
- Mass is conserved during changes of state
- Internal energy — sum of kinetic and potential energy of particles

### 3.2 Internal Energy and Energy Transfers
- Specific heat capacity (energy to raise 1kg by 1°C)
- Specific latent heat (energy to change state without temperature change)
- Latent heat of fusion vs latent heat of vaporisation
- Temperature stays constant during a change of state

### 3.3 Particle Model and Pressure
- Gas pressure caused by particle collisions with container walls
- Increasing temperature increases particle speed, increases pressure
- Reducing volume increases frequency of collisions, increases pressure
- Pressure and volume relationship (for a fixed mass at constant temperature)

## Common Misconceptions

- Particles themselves expand when heated (rather than moving more/further apart)
- Boiling and evaporation are the same thing
- Steam is visible (the visible "steam" is actually condensed water droplets)
- Gas particles are stationary between collisions
- Temperature continues to rise during a change of state
- Confusing specific heat capacity and specific latent heat

### Q1 — Particle arrangement
**Area:** 3.1 Changes of state
**Question:** "Describe what the particles are doing differently in a solid, a liquid, and a gas."
**Looking for:** Solid: vibrate in fixed positions, closely packed, regular arrangement. Liquid: move around each other, close together but no fixed position. Gas: move quickly in random directions, far apart.

### Q2 — Temperature during state change
**Area:** 3.2 Internal energy
**Question:** "If I heat ice from minus 10 degrees all the way up to 110 degrees, does the temperature rise steadily the whole time? What happens?"
**Looking for:** No — temperature stays constant during melting (0°C) and boiling (100°C). Energy goes into breaking bonds between particles rather than increasing kinetic energy. Flat sections on a heating curve.

### Q3 — Boiling vs evaporation
**Area:** 3.1 Changes of state
**Question:** "What's the difference between boiling and evaporation? Are they the same thing?"
**Looking for:** Boiling happens at a specific temperature throughout the liquid. Evaporation happens at any temperature, only from the surface. Boiling involves bubble formation. Evaporation is slower.

### Q4 — Gas pressure
**Area:** 3.3 Pressure
**Question:** "If I seal some gas in a container and heat it up, what happens to the pressure? Why?"
**Looking for:** Pressure increases. Particles move faster (more kinetic energy), hit the walls harder and more often. More frequent and forceful collisions = higher pressure.

### Q5 — Conservation of mass
**Area:** 3.1 Changes of state
**Question:** "When you melt an ice cube, does it weigh more, less, or the same? Why?"
**Looking for:** Same mass. No particles are added or removed — they just rearrange. Mass is conserved during changes of state.

### Q6 — Pumping air
**Area:** 3.3 Pressure
**Question:** "If I pump air into a bicycle tyre, why does the tyre get warm?"
**Looking for:** Compressing the gas — particles pushed closer together, more frequent collisions. Work is done on the gas, increasing internal energy. Energy transferred to thermal store.
