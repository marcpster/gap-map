# 7. Theme C: The Existence of God and Revelation

## Key Concepts

### 7.1 The Design Argument
- The teleological argument: the universe appears designed, so there must be a designer (God)
- **Paley's watch analogy:** if you found a watch on a heath, its complexity would indicate a watchmaker; the universe is far more complex, so it too must have a designer
- Strengths: the natural world shows evidence of purpose and order (e.g. the human eye, ecosystems); "The heavens declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1); Surah 2:164 points to signs of Allah in the natural world
- Weaknesses: evolution by natural selection (Darwin) explains apparent design without a designer; the universe also contains flaws and suffering — a perfect designer would not produce imperfect results; Hume argued we cannot compare the universe to a human-made object
- The anthropic principle: the universe appears fine-tuned for life — coincidence or design?

### 7.2 The First Cause Argument
- The cosmological argument: everything that exists has a cause; the universe exists, so it must have a first cause — God
- **Aquinas's Five Ways** (particularly the first three): the unmoved mover, the uncaused cause, the argument from contingency
- "For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities — his eternal power and divine nature — have been clearly seen" (Romans 1:20)
- Surah 2:164 — the creation of the heavens and earth, the alternation of night and day, are signs of Allah for those who understand
- Weaknesses: if everything needs a cause, what caused God? (the infinite regress problem); the Big Bang theory offers a scientific explanation for the origin of the universe without needing God; **Russell's teapot** — the burden of proof lies with the person claiming God exists, not with the person denying it
- Strengths: science explains how the universe began but not why; the Big Bang itself could be the mechanism God used

### 7.3 The Existence of Suffering
- The **problem of evil**: if God is omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient, why does suffering exist?
- The **inconsistent triad**: God is all-powerful + God is all-loving + evil exists — logically, all three cannot be true simultaneously
- **Moral evil:** suffering caused by human choices (war, crime, cruelty)
- **Natural evil:** suffering caused by the natural world (earthquakes, disease, famine)
- **Augustine's free will defence:** evil is not created by God but is the result of humans misusing free will; evil is a privation (absence of good), not a thing in itself
- **Irenaeus's soul-making theodicy:** suffering exists because it allows humans to grow, develop virtues, and become closer to God; the world is a "vale of soul-making"
- Christianity: the Book of Job — God allows suffering as a test of faith; God's ways are beyond human understanding; "The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away" (Job 1:21)
- Islam: suffering is a test from Allah; patience (sabr) during hardship brings reward; "Do people think they will be left alone because they say 'We believe' and will not be tested?" (Surah 29:2)

### 7.4 Visions and Miracles
- **Visions:** seeing or perceiving something beyond normal experience, often believed to be from God
  - Examples: Saul's vision of Jesus on the road to Damascus (Acts 9); Muhammad's Night Journey (Isra and Mi'raj); visions of the Virgin Mary at Lourdes
  - Significance: can convert people, strengthen faith, provide guidance
- **Miracles:** events that apparently break the laws of nature and are attributed to God
  - Jesus' miracles: healing the sick, raising Lazarus, feeding the 5,000, walking on water
  - Islamic miracles: the Qur'an itself is considered the greatest miracle (its literary perfection); the splitting of the moon
  - Challenges: could be coincidence, exaggeration, or misunderstanding; Hume argued miracles are the least likely explanation for any event; science may eventually explain seemingly miraculous events

### 7.5 Religious Experience
- **Numinous experience:** a feeling of awe and wonder in the presence of something greater than oneself (e.g. standing in a cathedral, gazing at the night sky)
- **Conversion experience:** a life-changing moment that leads someone to adopt a faith or deepen existing belief (e.g. Saul/Paul on the road to Damascus)
- **Prayer:** communicating with God; many believers report answered prayers or a sense of God's presence during prayer
- **Mystical experience:** a direct, personal encounter with the divine; difficult to put into words
- Value as evidence for God: deeply convincing for the person who experiences it; millions of people across different cultures and religions report similar experiences
- Challenges: could be psychological, neurological, or culturally conditioned; cannot be tested or repeated; different religions interpret experiences differently — they cannot all be right

### 7.6 General and Special Revelation
- **General revelation:** God making himself known through ordinary experiences available to all people
  - Nature and the created world: "The heavens declare the glory of God" (Psalm 19:1); Surah 2:164 — signs of Allah in creation
  - Conscience: an inner sense of right and wrong, which some believe is God's voice within
  - Available to everyone, regardless of faith
- **Special revelation:** God making himself known through direct, specific means
  - **Scripture:** the Bible as God's word to Christians; the Qur'an as the literal word of Allah revealed through Jibril to Muhammad
  - **Prophets:** individuals chosen by God to communicate his message (e.g. Musa/Moses, Isa/Jesus, Muhammad)
  - **Jesus Christ:** Christians believe Jesus is God incarnate — the ultimate special revelation ("the Word became flesh", John 1:14)
  - **Enlightenment and mystical experience:** direct personal encounters with the divine
- The 99 Names of Allah reveal aspects of God's nature — a form of revelation through description

### 7.7 Arguments Against the Existence of God
- **Scientific explanations:** the Big Bang explains the origin of the universe; evolution by natural selection explains the diversity of life — no designer needed; Dawkins argues science removes the need for God as an explanation
- **The problem of evil:** if God is all-powerful and all-loving, he would prevent suffering — suffering exists, therefore God (as traditionally described) does not exist
- **Lack of evidence:** no empirical, testable evidence for God's existence; **Russell's teapot** — claiming something exists without evidence does not make it true; absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but the burden of proof lies with the believer
- **Atheism:** the belief that God does not exist; based on reason, evidence, and science
- **Agnosticism:** the view that we cannot know whether God exists or not — the question is unanswerable
- **Humanism:** a non-religious worldview that values human reason, ethics, and justice without reference to God; morality is possible without religion
- Religious responses: faith goes beyond what science can measure; personal experience of God is valid evidence for the individual; the existence of the universe and moral law point to something beyond the physical

## Common Misconceptions

- The design and first cause arguments prove God exists (they are arguments that support belief, not proofs — they have well-known weaknesses)
- Science and religion are always in conflict (many believers accept both scientific explanations and belief in God — e.g. the Big Bang as God's method of creation)
- The problem of evil automatically disproves God (theodicies offer explanations for why God might allow suffering)
- Miracles are only claimed in ancient texts (many believers today report miraculous experiences, e.g. healings at Lourdes)
- Religious experience is the same as hallucination (believers distinguish between genuine spiritual experience and mental illness; the transformative effect on a person's life is considered evidence of authenticity)
- Atheists have no morality (humanism provides a framework for ethics based on reason and empathy, without God)
- All religious people reject evolution (many Christians and Muslims accept evolution as compatible with belief in God as creator)

### Q1 — The design argument
**Area:** 7.1 The Design Argument
**Question:** "What is Paley's watch argument, and what is it trying to prove about God?"
**Looking for:** Paley said if you found a watch, its complexity would show it had a designer. The universe is even more complex and shows signs of purpose, so it too must have a designer — God. This is the teleological/design argument.

### Q2 — The problem of evil
**Area:** 7.3 The Existence of Suffering
**Question:** "What is the 'inconsistent triad', and why is it a problem for people who believe in God?"
**Looking for:** The inconsistent triad = God is omnipotent + God is omnibenevolent + evil exists. Logically all three cannot be true at the same time. If God is all-powerful and all-loving, he would stop evil — but evil exists. So either God is not all-powerful, not all-loving, or does not exist.

### Q3 — The First Cause argument
**Area:** 7.2 The First Cause Argument
**Question:** "Explain two strengths or two weaknesses of the First Cause argument for God's existence."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from strengths: (1) everything in our experience has a cause, so the universe must too, (2) science explains how but not why the universe began, (3) the Big Bang itself needs a cause. Or from weaknesses: (1) if everything has a cause, what caused God? (infinite regress), (2) the Big Bang provides a scientific explanation without needing God, (3) Russell's teapot — the burden of proof is on the person claiming God exists. Each point stated and then developed.

### Q4 — Religious experience
**Area:** 7.4 / 7.5 Visions, Miracles, and Religious Experience
**Question:** "Explain two types of religious experience that some people use as evidence for God's existence."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) numinous experience — a feeling of awe and wonder in the presence of something greater, (2) miracles — events that break the laws of nature and are attributed to God (e.g. Jesus' healings, the Qur'an's literary perfection), (3) visions — seeing something beyond normal experience (e.g. Saul on the road to Damascus), (4) conversion — a life-changing moment of faith, (5) answered prayer. Each type should be named, described, and its evidential value explained.

### Q5 — General and special revelation
**Area:** 7.6 General and Special Revelation
**Question:** "Explain two differences between general revelation and special revelation. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) general revelation is available to everyone — through nature, conscience, the created world; special revelation is God communicating directly to specific people, (2) examples of general revelation — the natural world showing God's power ("The heavens declare the glory of God", Psalm 19:1; signs of Allah in nature, Surah 2:164), (3) examples of special revelation — the Qur'an revealed through Jibril, Jesus as the incarnation of God (John 1:14), the Bible as God's word, visions to prophets. Must include at least one scripture reference or authoritative source.

### Q6 — Science vs belief in God
**Area:** 7.7 / 7.1 / 7.2
**Question:** "Science has made belief in God pointless. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** The Big Bang explains the origin of the universe without needing a creator; evolution explains life without a designer; Dawkins argues science removes the need for God; there is no testable evidence for God — Russell's teapot; as science advances, the gaps where God is needed shrink ("God of the gaps")
- **Arguments against:** Science explains how, not why — it cannot address questions of meaning and purpose; many scientists are religious; the Big Bang could be the mechanism God used; the fine-tuning of the universe suggests a designer; science cannot explain consciousness, morality, or love; personal religious experience is evidence that science cannot measure
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view that engages with both sides
- **Level indicators:** L4 = multiple developed arguments from both sides with specific references to scientific theories, religious teachings, and named thinkers; justified conclusion. L1 = simple opinion without reasoning

### Q7 — The problem of suffering (cross-religious evaluation)
**Area:** 7.3 / 7.7
**Question:** "No loving God would allow innocent people to suffer. Discuss this statement. You should refer to Christianity and Islam and non-religious arguments in your answer."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** The inconsistent triad — an all-powerful, all-loving God would prevent innocent suffering; natural evil (earthquakes, disease) cannot be blamed on human free will; the scale of suffering in the world (famine, child illness) seems incompatible with a loving God; atheists and humanists argue suffering is evidence against God's existence
- **Arguments against:** Christianity — free will defence (Augustine): God gave humans freedom, and evil results from misuse of that freedom; suffering builds character and brings people closer to God (Irenaeus's soul-making theodicy); the Book of Job shows faith being tested and God's plan being beyond human understanding. Islam — suffering is a test from Allah; patience (sabr) brings reward; "Do people think they will be left alone because they say 'We believe' and will not be tested?" (Surah 29:2); Allah is just and merciful — rewards await in the afterlife. Non-religious response — suffering has natural causes, not divine ones, but that does not mean it is meaningless; humanists work to reduce suffering through human effort
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view engaging with at least two perspectives
- **Level indicators:** L4 = developed arguments referencing both Christianity and Islam with specific teachings/scripture, engagement with non-religious views, justified conclusion. L1 = simple opinion from one perspective only

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "Can you talk me through Paley's watch argument? What's the basic idea — and can you think of any problems with it?"
- "If someone said to you 'the universe must have had a first cause, and that cause is God', how would you respond? What are the strengths and weaknesses of that argument?"
- "Why is suffering such a big problem for people who believe in God? How do Christians and Muslims each deal with it?"
- "Someone tells you they had a religious experience — they felt God's presence during prayer. Is that good evidence that God exists? Why or why not?"
- "What's the difference between general revelation and special revelation? Can you give me an example of each from Christianity and Islam?"
- "I'm going to argue that science has explained everything and there's no need for God any more — challenge me on that."
- "If a Christian and a Muslim both believe in the same God, why do they have different ideas about revelation?"
