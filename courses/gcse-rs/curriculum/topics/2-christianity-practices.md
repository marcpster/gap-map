# 2. Christianity: Practices

## Key Concepts

### 2.1 Worship
- Liturgical worship: set order of service, formal prayers, readings (Catholic, Anglican, Orthodox)
- Non-liturgical worship: less structured, focus on Bible readings and sermons (Baptist, Methodist)
- Informal worship: spontaneous prayer, speaking in tongues, singing (Charismatic, Quaker)
- "Where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them" (Matthew 18:20)

### 2.2 Prayer
- The Lord's Prayer (Matthew 6:9–13): model prayer taught by Jesus
- Set/formal prayers: written prayers used in services (e.g. Book of Common Prayer)
- Informal prayer: personal, spontaneous conversation with God
- Contemplative prayer: silent meditation on God's presence
- "Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God" (Philippians 4:6)

### 2.3 Sacraments
- Sacraments: outward signs of inward grace; Catholics recognise seven, Protestants typically two
- **Baptism:**
  - Infant baptism (Catholic, Anglican): parents and godparents make promises; water symbolises washing away of original sin
  - Believers' baptism (Baptist): full immersion as a conscious adult choice; public declaration of faith
- **Holy Communion (Eucharist):**
  - Remembers the Last Supper — "Do this in remembrance of me" (Luke 22:19)
  - Catholic: transubstantiation — bread and wine become the actual body and blood of Christ
  - Protestant: symbolic remembrance — bread and wine represent body and blood

### 2.4 Pilgrimage
- Lourdes (France): site of Marian apparitions; healing; 6 million visitors per year
- Iona (Scotland): ancient Celtic Christian community; spiritual retreat and reflection
- Purposes: spiritual renewal, healing, penance, connection to Christian history
- Some Christians argue pilgrimage is unnecessary — God is everywhere

### 2.5 Celebrations
- **Christmas:** celebrates the Incarnation — birth of Jesus; Advent preparation; Midnight Mass; gift-giving symbolises the Magi
- **Easter:** most important Christian festival; Good Friday (Crucifixion), Easter Sunday (Resurrection); services, communion, renewal of baptismal vows
- "He is not here; he has risen!" (Luke 24:6)

### 2.6 The Role of the Church in the Local Community
- Food banks, homeless shelters, community centres
- Education — church schools, Sunday schools
- Social activities bringing people together
- Pastoral care — visiting the sick, supporting the bereaved
- "Faith without deeds is dead" (James 2:26)

### 2.7 Mission and Evangelism
- The Great Commission: "Go and make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19)
- Evangelism: spreading the gospel through preaching, media, personal testimony
- Mission: serving others practically and spiritually; overseas aid and development work
- Alpha Course: introductory course on Christianity

### 2.8 Church Growth
- Christianity is the world's largest religion (~2.4 billion)
- Rapid growth in the Global South (Africa, South America, Asia)
- Persecution of Christians in some countries
- Ecumenical movement: efforts to unite different Christian denominations
- World Council of Churches; local Churches Together groups

## Common Misconceptions

- All Christians worship in the same way (worship varies hugely across denominations)
- Baptism is just a naming ceremony (it is a sacrament with theological significance)
- Catholics and Protestants believe the same thing about Communion (transubstantiation vs symbolic)
- Pilgrimage is compulsory for Christians (it is encouraged but not required)
- Christmas is the most important Christian festival (Easter is — the Resurrection is central to faith)
- Evangelism means forcing beliefs on others (it means sharing, not imposing)
- The ecumenical movement means all Christians should become one Church (it seeks unity, not uniformity)

### Q1 — Types of worship
**Area:** 2.1 Worship
**Question:** "What is the difference between liturgical worship and non-liturgical worship?"
**Looking for:** Liturgical = set order, formal prayers, structured service (e.g. Catholic Mass). Non-liturgical = less formal, focus on sermons and Bible readings, more flexible (e.g. Baptist). May mention informal/charismatic as a third type.

### Q2 — Sacraments: baptism
**Area:** 2.3 Sacraments
**Question:** "What are the two main types of baptism in Christianity, and what is the key difference between them?"
**Looking for:** Infant baptism — baby is baptised, parents/godparents make promises, water poured/sprinkled. Believers' baptism — adult makes own conscious decision, full immersion. Key difference: choice made by parents vs personal decision.

### Q3 — Holy Communion
**Area:** 2.3 Sacraments
**Question:** "Explain two different Christian views about what happens during Holy Communion."
**Looking for:** Two from: (1) Catholic transubstantiation — bread and wine literally become body and blood of Christ, (2) Protestant symbolic — bread and wine represent/remember Jesus's sacrifice, (3) Lutheran consubstantiation — Christ is present alongside the bread and wine. Each point stated and developed with reasoning or significance.

### Q4 — Mission and evangelism
**Area:** 2.7 Mission and evangelism
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why mission and evangelism are important to Christians."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) the Great Commission — Jesus commanded it (Matthew 28:19), (2) sharing the message of salvation — they believe it transforms lives, (3) following Jesus's example — he healed, taught, served, (4) practical mission — serving the poor puts faith into action (James 2:26). Development explains why, not just what.

### Q5 — Pilgrimage
**Area:** 2.4 Pilgrimage
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why a Christian might go on a pilgrimage. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two from: (1) spiritual renewal and getting closer to God, (2) seeking healing — e.g. Lourdes, (3) penance and reflection on faith, (4) connection to Christian history and tradition. Must include a reference — could be biblical (e.g. Jesus's own pilgrimages to Jerusalem, Psalm 84:5 "Blessed are those whose strength is in you, whose hearts are set on pilgrimage") or reference to a specific pilgrimage site and its significance.

### Q6 — The role of the Church
**Area:** 2.6 The role of the Church in the local community
**Question:** "The Church is outdated and no longer needed in modern communities. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** Secular charities can do the same work; church attendance declining; communities have other support networks; some see the Church as out of touch on social issues
- **Arguments against:** Food banks, homeless shelters — churches fill gaps the state cannot; pastoral care and community belonging; moral guidance; "faith without deeds is dead" (James 2:26); education through church schools; sense of belonging and identity
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view engaging with both sides
- **Level indicators:** L4 = developed arguments from multiple perspectives with specific examples and teachings; L1 = simple assertion without reasoning

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "Why do you think some Christians prefer formal, liturgical worship while others prefer something more spontaneous?"
- "Is infant baptism fair? The baby didn't choose it. What would a Baptist say about that?"
- "If bread and wine are just symbols, why does it matter so much to Christians? And if Catholics really believe it becomes Jesus's body, how does that work?"
- "I'm going to argue that Christians shouldn't try to convert people — it's disrespectful to other beliefs. Make the case for why they do it."
- "Why would someone travel hundreds of miles to pray at Lourdes when they could pray at home? What's the point of pilgrimage?"
- "What would happen in your local area if all the churches closed tomorrow?"
