# 9. Theme E: Religion, Crime and Punishment

## Key Concepts

### 9.1 Reasons for Crime
- Poverty — lack of resources can drive people to theft or drug dealing to survive
- Upbringing — children who witness criminal behaviour or experience neglect may be more likely to offend
- Mental illness — some crimes are linked to untreated mental health conditions; raises questions about responsibility
- Greed and selfishness — desire for wealth or status beyond what is needed
- Opposition to unjust laws — civil disobedience; some break laws they believe are morally wrong (e.g. Rosa Parks, Dietrich Bonhoeffer)
- Addiction — drugs and alcohol can drive people to commit crimes to fund habits
- Religious perspective: Christians and Muslims believe humans have free will and are responsible for their choices, but also recognise that social conditions contribute to crime

### 9.2 Religious Attitudes to Lawbreakers
- **Christianity:** Jesus taught forgiveness and compassion for sinners — "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone" (John 8:7); Jesus ate with tax collectors and sinners; Christians should hate the sin but love the sinner
- **Islam:** Shari'ah law provides a framework for justice; the Qur'an teaches both justice and mercy; Muslims believe in personal accountability before Allah on the Day of Judgement
- Both religions teach that lawbreakers should be treated with dignity and offered the chance to reform
- Forgiveness does not mean ignoring justice — both traditions hold that there must be consequences for wrongdoing

### 9.3 Three Aims of Punishment
- **Retribution:** punishment as payback — the offender suffers in proportion to the crime; "an eye for an eye" (Exodus 21:24); Surah 5:45 allows proportionate retribution
- **Deterrence:** punishment aims to put off the offender (and others) from committing crime again; severe sentences intended to frighten potential offenders
- **Reformation:** punishment aims to change the offender's behaviour and help them become a law-abiding citizen; education, counselling, rehabilitation programmes
- Christians tend to emphasise reformation — belief that people can change through God's grace
- Islam supports all three but emphasises that punishment must be just and proportionate; Shari'ah prescribes specific punishments (hudud) for certain crimes but also stresses mercy

### 9.4 Religious Attitudes to Suffering
- **Redemptive suffering:** Christians believe suffering can bring people closer to God; Jesus suffered on the cross to redeem humanity — suffering can have meaning and purpose
- **Punishment from God:** some religious believers see suffering as a consequence of sin or wrongdoing; the Fall brought suffering into the world (Genesis 3)
- **Test of faith:** both Christians and Muslims believe God may allow suffering to test and strengthen faith; "Do the people think that they will be left to say, 'We believe' and they will not be tried?" (Surah 29:2)
- Islam teaches that suffering in this life can be a purification — enduring it with patience (sabr) brings reward from Allah
- Non-religious view: suffering is a natural part of life with no divine purpose; the focus should be on reducing it through social action

### 9.5 Treatment of Criminals
- **Prison:** removes dangerous offenders from society; provides opportunity for reform through education and programmes; risk of reoffending if no rehabilitation
- **Community service:** offenders give back to the community they harmed; allows them to maintain family ties and employment; not suitable for serious offences
- **Religious attitudes to corporal punishment:** physical punishment (e.g. caning, flogging); Shari'ah prescribes corporal punishment for some offences (e.g. Surah 5:38 — punishment for theft); most Christians oppose it as degrading, though some point to Old Testament precedents; many Muslims argue Shari'ah conditions are so strict that punishments are rarely carried out in practice
- Human rights perspective: corporal punishment violates human dignity and is banned in many countries

### 9.6 Forgiveness
- **Christianity:** forgiveness is central — "Forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us" (Lord's Prayer); Jesus forgave those who crucified him — "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing" (Luke 23:34); Parable of the Unforgiving Servant (Matthew 18:21-35) — those who receive forgiveness must also forgive; Christians believe God's forgiveness is available to all who repent
- **Islam:** "Allah is the Most Forgiving, the Most Merciful" (Surah 39:53); Surah 42:40 — "The reward of an evil deed is its equivalent, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allah"; forgiveness is highly valued but not always required — victims have the right to seek justice
- **When forgiveness is difficult:** crimes such as murder, abuse, or terrorism test the limits of forgiveness; some argue forgiveness is for the victim's benefit (letting go of anger); others say some acts are unforgivable and it is wrong to pressure victims to forgive
- Non-religious view: forgiveness can be psychologically healthy but should never be forced; justice must come first

### 9.7 The Death Penalty
- **Arguments for:** ultimate deterrent; protects society permanently; retribution — some crimes are so severe that only death is proportionate; some Old Testament passages support it — "Do not murder" (Exodus 20:13) implies the sanctity of life, and Genesis 9:6 — "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed"
- **Arguments against:** risk of executing innocent people; does not allow for reformation; "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone" (John 8:7); only God has the right to take life — sanctity of life
- **Christianity:** divided — many Christians oppose it (Catholic Church, Church of England); some support it based on Old Testament law; most emphasise that Jesus taught mercy and forgiveness
- **Islam:** Shari'ah allows the death penalty for certain crimes (e.g. murder, adultery) but with very strict conditions of evidence; the family of the victim can choose to forgive instead — "Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain all mankind" (Surah 5:32); preference for mercy is emphasised
- **Non-religious arguments:** Amnesty International campaigns against it worldwide; human rights — the state should not have the power to kill; no evidence it deters crime more effectively than imprisonment; utilitarian argument — resources better spent on rehabilitation

## Common Misconceptions

- All religious people oppose the death penalty (some Christians and Muslims support it under specific conditions)
- Shari'ah law is only about harsh punishments (it covers all aspects of life and emphasises justice, mercy, and community welfare)
- Forgiveness means letting criminals go free (forgiveness is about the offender's moral status, not escaping consequences)
- Retribution and revenge are the same thing (retribution is proportionate and carried out by the state; revenge is personal and often disproportionate)
- All Christians believe suffering is God's punishment for sin (many see it as a test, a mystery, or a result of free will)
- Islam has no concept of forgiveness or mercy (mercy and forgiveness are among Allah's most prominent attributes)
- Prison always reforms people (reoffending rates suggest prison alone is often insufficient without rehabilitation programmes)

### Q1 — Reasons for crime
**Area:** 9.1 Reasons for crime
**Question:** "Give three reasons why people might commit crimes."
**Looking for:** Any three from: poverty, upbringing, mental illness, greed, addiction, opposition to unjust laws. Brief identification is sufficient — no development needed.

### Q2 — Aims of punishment
**Area:** 9.3 Three aims of punishment
**Question:** "What are the three main aims of punishment? Give a brief explanation of each."
**Looking for:** Retribution — making the offender pay for what they did. Deterrence — putting people off committing crime. Reformation — changing the offender so they do not reoffend. Correct term + correct definition for each.

### Q3 — Religious teachings on forgiveness
**Area:** 9.6 Forgiveness
**Question:** "Explain two religious teachings about forgiveness."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Jesus forgave those who crucified him (Luke 23:34) — shows forgiveness even in extreme suffering, (2) the Lord's Prayer — Christians ask God to forgive them as they forgive others, implying a duty to forgive, (3) Parable of the Unforgiving Servant — God's forgiveness depends on our willingness to forgive, (4) Allah is the Most Forgiving (Surah 39:53) — mercy is central to God's nature in Islam, (5) Surah 42:40 — pardoning brings reward from Allah. Each point should be stated and then developed with explanation of significance.

### Q4 — Treatment of criminals
**Area:** 9.5 Treatment of criminals
**Question:** "Explain two different ways criminals can be treated, and give a religious perspective on one of them."
**Looking for:** Two from: prison, community service, corporal punishment. For each, a brief explanation of how it works. Religious perspective developed — e.g. Christians support reformation through prison chaplaincy; Islam's Shari'ah prescribes specific punishments but with strict conditions; many religious believers support community service because it restores relationships.

### Q5 — Religious attitudes to lawbreakers and suffering
**Area:** 9.2 / 9.4
**Question:** "Explain two religious attitudes to why people who break the law should still be treated with compassion. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Jesus said "Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone" (John 8:7) — no one is perfect, so compassion is required, (2) "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Mark 12:31) — applies even to criminals, (3) suffering can be redemptive — treating lawbreakers with compassion allows for transformation, (4) Islam teaches mercy — "Allah is the Most Forgiving" (Surah 39:53) — Muslims should reflect God's mercy, (5) both religions teach that people can repent and change. Must include at least one specific scripture reference with development.

### Q6 — The death penalty
**Area:** 9.7 The death penalty
**Question:** "The death penalty can never be justified. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for the statement (against the death penalty):** only God has the right to take life — sanctity of life; Jesus taught forgiveness, not retribution (John 8:7); risk of executing innocent people; does not allow for reformation; Amnesty International argues it violates human rights; "Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain all mankind" (Surah 5:32)
- **Arguments against the statement (for the death penalty):** some crimes are so severe that only death is proportionate; Genesis 9:6 — "Whoever sheds human blood, by humans shall their blood be shed"; Shari'ah allows it for certain crimes with strict conditions; protects society from the most dangerous offenders; some argue it is the ultimate deterrent
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view that engages with the weight of arguments on both sides
- **Level indicators:** L4 = developed arguments from multiple religious and non-religious perspectives with specific references, justified conclusion; L1 = simple opinion without reasoning or evidence

### Q7 — Forgiveness and justice (cross-religious evaluation)
**Area:** 9.6 / 9.2
**Question:** "Forgiveness is more important than punishment. Discuss this statement. You should refer to Christian and Muslim teachings and non-religious arguments in your answer, and reach a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** Jesus forgave those who crucified him (Luke 23:34) — the ultimate example of forgiveness over punishment; the Lord's Prayer ties God's forgiveness to human forgiveness; Surah 42:40 — pardoning brings reward from Allah, suggesting forgiveness is the higher path; forgiveness breaks cycles of violence and resentment; psychological benefits for victims
- **Arguments against:** justice requires consequences — without punishment, laws have no force; Shari'ah prescribes specific punishments for good reason — to protect society (Surah 5:38); retribution gives victims a sense of justice; deterrence protects potential future victims; non-religious view — utilitarian argument that punishment prevents greater harm; forgiveness without accountability can enable repeat offending
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view — many candidates may argue they are complementary rather than opposed; the best answers will engage with the tension between mercy and justice in both traditions
- **Level indicators:** L4 = well-argued with developed reasoning from Christian, Muslim, and non-religious perspectives, specific teachings cited accurately, justified conclusion that addresses the tension; L1 = simple opinion, one religion or none referenced

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "Why do you think people commit crimes? Is it always a choice, or are some people pushed into it?"
- "What's the difference between retribution and revenge? Can you think of why that distinction matters?"
- "Jesus forgave the people who were killing him. Do you think that's realistic to expect of ordinary people, or is it an impossible standard?"
- "I'm going to argue that the death penalty is the only fair punishment for murder — the victim lost their life, so the criminal should lose theirs. Challenge me."
- "If someone commits a terrible crime but is genuinely sorry, should they still be punished? What would a Christian say? What would a Muslim say?"
- "Some people say prison doesn't work because so many people reoffend. What do you reckon — is there a better way?"
- "Is there a difference between forgiving someone and saying what they did was acceptable? How would you explain that distinction?"
