# 8. Theme D: Religion, Peace and Conflict

## Key Concepts

### 8.1 Violence and Terrorism
- **Violence:** the use of physical force to cause harm, damage, or destruction
- Most religious believers condemn violence — it goes against the sanctity of life
- Christianity: "Do not murder" (Exodus 20:13); "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Mark 12:31)
- Islam: "Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain all mankind" (Surah 5:32)
- **Terrorism:** the unlawful use of violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in pursuit of political or ideological aims
- All mainstream religious traditions condemn terrorism — it targets innocents and uses fear as a weapon
- Extremism is a distortion of religious teaching, not a faithful expression of it
- Non-religious views: terrorism is condemned on secular ethical grounds — violates human rights, causes disproportionate suffering

### 8.2 Reasons for War
- **Self-defence:** protecting a nation from invasion or attack
- **Retaliation:** responding to aggression or injustice
- **Resources and land:** fighting over territory, oil, water, or economic advantage
- **Greed and power:** wars driven by desire for control and domination
- **Ideology:** fighting to impose or defend a political or religious system
- **Humanitarian intervention:** military action to prevent genocide or mass atrocities
- Religious perspectives: most traditions accept that war may sometimes be necessary (as a last resort), but seek to limit and regulate it

### 8.3 The Just War Theory
- A set of criteria for determining when going to war is morally acceptable and how it should be conducted
- **Christian Just War theory (Aquinas and later thinkers):**
  - Must be declared by a legitimate authority (e.g. a government, not a private individual)
  - Must have a just cause (e.g. self-defence, protecting the innocent)
  - Must be a last resort — all peaceful alternatives must have been tried
  - The aim must be to bring about good and overcome evil — right intention
  - There must be a reasonable chance of success — no futile wars
  - Proportional force: the violence used must not be greater than the evil being fought
  - Civilians must not be targeted (non-combatant immunity)
- **Lesser jihad in Islam — conditions:**
  - Must be in self-defence or to protect the oppressed: "Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress" (Surah 2:190)
  - Must be declared by a legitimate religious authority
  - Must be a last resort — peace must be sought first: "If they incline to peace, you also incline to it" (Surah 8:61)
  - Must not harm civilians, children, the elderly, or religious buildings
  - Must stop when the enemy surrenders
  - Proportional response: "do not transgress" — no excess
- Similarities: both traditions require just cause, legitimate authority, last resort, proportionality, and protection of civilians
- Differences: lesser jihad includes specifically religious authority; Just War theory developed more formal philosophical criteria through Aquinas

### 8.4 Holy War
- A war fought for a religious cause or on the command of God
- **Christianity:** the Crusades (11th–13th centuries) — wars to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim control; Pope Urban II declared it God's will; participants believed they would receive spiritual reward
- **Islam:** some interpret lesser jihad as holy war, though mainstream scholarship restricts it to defensive warfare with strict conditions
- Most modern religious leaders reject the concept of holy war — it is too easily misused to justify violence
- Holy war differs from Just War: holy war claims divine authority and religious obligation; Just War uses ethical reasoning and applies restraint
- The concept is historically significant but widely criticised today

### 8.5 Pacifism
- The belief that all violence and war are wrong and that disputes should be resolved peacefully
- **Christian pacifism:**
  - "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God" (Matthew 5:9)
  - "Turn the other cheek" (Matthew 5:39) — do not respond to violence with violence
  - "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44)
  - **Quakers (Religious Society of Friends):** committed pacifists; believe there is "that of God" in every person and violence is never justified
  - **Conscientious objectors:** those who refuse to fight in wars on moral or religious grounds
- **Islam:** Greater jihad (the internal struggle to live a good Muslim life) is considered more important than lesser jihad; peace is the ideal: "If they incline to peace, you also incline to it" (Surah 8:61)
- **Martin Luther King Jr:** Christian minister who led the American civil rights movement through non-violent protest; inspired by Jesus' teachings and Mahatma Gandhi
- **Non-religious pacifism:** based on the belief that violence always creates more harm than good; secular peace organisations work for conflict resolution and diplomacy

### 8.6 Weapons of Mass Destruction
- **Weapons of mass destruction (WMDs):** nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons capable of killing large numbers of people indiscriminately
- **Nuclear weapons:** the most destructive weapons ever created; Hiroshima and Nagasaki (1945) demonstrated their devastating power
- **Deterrence theory:** the argument that possessing nuclear weapons prevents war because enemies fear mutual destruction (Mutually Assured Destruction — MAD)
- **Religious attitudes:**
  - Christianity: most Christians oppose WMDs — they cause indiscriminate suffering, violate Just War principles (proportionality, non-combatant immunity); the Catholic Church has called for nuclear disarmament
  - Islam: WMDs contradict lesser jihad conditions — civilians must not be harmed, destruction must be proportionate; many Muslim scholars condemn their use outright
- **Non-religious views:** utilitarians might argue deterrence prevents greater suffering overall, but others argue the risk of catastrophe outweighs any benefit; WMDs violate human rights principles
- The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) campaigns for the elimination of all nuclear weapons

### 8.7 The Role of Religion in Peacemaking
- Religious organisations and individuals play a significant role in promoting peace, reconciliation, and forgiveness
- **Christianity:**
  - "Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matthew 5:9)
  - **Forgiveness:** central to Christian teaching — the Lord's Prayer: "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us"
  - **Reconciliation:** restoring relationships after conflict; modelled on God reconciling with humanity through Jesus
  - **Corrymeela Community:** a Christian peace organisation in Northern Ireland working for reconciliation between Protestant and Catholic communities
  - **Desmond Tutu and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission:** used Christian principles of forgiveness to heal South Africa after apartheid
- **Islam:**
  - Peace is a core value: "As-Salaam" (the Source of Peace) is one of the 99 Names of Allah
  - Forgiveness is encouraged: "The repayment of a bad action is one equivalent to it. But whoever pardons and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allah" (Surah 42:40)
  - **Islamic Relief:** a humanitarian organisation inspired by Islamic values, working in conflict zones worldwide
- **Non-religious peacemaking:** secular organisations such as the United Nations, Amnesty International, and Médecins Sans Frontières work for peace, human rights, and humanitarian aid without religious motivation
- **Justice and forgiveness:** some argue that true peace requires justice first — forgiveness without accountability can allow injustice to continue; others argue forgiveness breaks the cycle of violence

## Common Misconceptions

- Religion is the main cause of war (most wars are fought over land, resources, or power — religion is sometimes used to justify conflict but is rarely the root cause)
- Jihad means "holy war" (greater jihad is the personal spiritual struggle; lesser jihad is defensive warfare with strict conditions — it is not an open licence for violence)
- All Christians are pacifists (many accept Just War theory; pacifism is a specific tradition within Christianity, most strongly associated with Quakers)
- Just War theory means Christians support war (it sets strict conditions that must be met — it is a framework for limiting and regulating war, not encouraging it)
- Nuclear deterrence keeps everyone safe (it relies on the assumption that leaders act rationally; accidents, miscalculation, or extremism could lead to catastrophe)
- Forgiveness means letting people off without consequences (religious forgiveness often accompanies a call for justice and accountability — reconciliation is not the same as excusing wrongdoing)

### Q1 — Just War theory
**Area:** 8.3 The Just War Theory
**Question:** "Give three conditions that must be met for a war to be considered a 'Just War' according to Christian teaching."
**Looking for:** Any three from: declared by a legitimate authority; just cause (e.g. self-defence); last resort; right intention (to bring about good); reasonable chance of success; proportional force; civilians must not be targeted. Credit for naming Aquinas as the source.

### Q2 — Pacifism
**Area:** 8.5 Pacifism
**Question:** "What is pacifism, and which Christian group is most closely associated with it?"
**Looking for:** Pacifism = the belief that all violence and war are wrong, and disputes should be resolved peacefully. Quakers (Religious Society of Friends) are the group most closely associated with Christian pacifism. Bonus: mentions conscientious objectors, Martin Luther King Jr, or "Blessed are the peacemakers."

### Q3 — Violence and terrorism
**Area:** 8.1 Violence and Terrorism
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why religious believers are against terrorism."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) it targets innocent civilians, violating the sanctity of life, (2) Christianity teaches "Do not murder" (Exodus 20:13) and "Love your neighbour" — terrorism contradicts both, (3) Islam teaches "Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain all mankind" (Surah 5:32), (4) it uses fear and violence to achieve aims — opposite of religious teachings on peace and justice, (5) extremism distorts religious teaching and damages the reputation of the faith community. Each point stated and then developed.

### Q4 — Weapons of mass destruction
**Area:** 8.6 Weapons of Mass Destruction
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why many religious believers oppose nuclear weapons."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) nuclear weapons kill indiscriminately — they cannot distinguish between combatants and civilians, violating Just War principles, (2) the scale of destruction is disproportionate — millions could die, which contradicts the principle of proportionality, (3) they cause long-term environmental damage and suffering (radiation, fallout) — incompatible with stewardship of creation, (4) Islam's lesser jihad conditions prohibit harming civilians and require proportionate response, (5) many religious leaders and organisations have called for disarmament (e.g. the Catholic Church). Each point stated and then developed.

### Q5 — Holy war and lesser jihad
**Area:** 8.3 / 8.4 Just War and Holy War
**Question:** "Explain two conditions of lesser jihad in Islam. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two developed conditions from: (1) must be in self-defence or to protect the oppressed — "Fight in the way of Allah those who fight you, but do not transgress" (Surah 2:190), (2) must be declared by a legitimate religious authority, (3) must be a last resort — peace must be sought first — "If they incline to peace, you also incline to it" (Surah 8:61), (4) must not harm civilians, children, the elderly, or places of worship, (5) must stop when the enemy surrenders, (6) must use proportional force. Must include at least one Qur'anic reference or authoritative Islamic source.

### Q6 — Pacifism vs Just War
**Area:** 8.5 / 8.3
**Question:** "War is never the right response — violence always makes things worse. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** Jesus taught "turn the other cheek" (Matthew 5:39) and "love your enemies" (Matthew 5:44); Quakers believe all violence is wrong — there is "that of God" in every person; Martin Luther King Jr achieved change through non-violence; war causes immense suffering to civilians and combatants; violence breeds more violence — a cycle that peace breaks; Islam values peace — greater jihad (spiritual struggle) is more important than lesser jihad
- **Arguments against:** Just War theory allows war as a last resort when all peaceful means have failed; self-defence is a moral right — letting aggression go unchallenged allows greater evil; Islam permits lesser jihad to protect the oppressed (Surah 2:190); humanitarian intervention may be necessary to stop genocide; pacifism can be seen as allowing evil to continue unchecked; Dietrich Bonhoeffer — a Christian pacifist who ultimately supported the plot to assassinate Hitler because he believed inaction was worse
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view engaging with both sides
- **Level indicators:** L4 = multiple developed arguments from both sides with specific teachings, examples, and named thinkers; justified conclusion. L1 = simple opinion without reasoning

### Q7 — Religion and peacemaking (cross-religious evaluation)
**Area:** 8.7 / 8.5
**Question:** "Religious people have a duty to work for peace and forgiveness, even when it is difficult. Discuss this statement. You should refer to Christianity and Islam and non-religious arguments in your answer."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** Christianity — "Blessed are the peacemakers" (Matthew 5:9); Jesus taught forgiveness — "Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us" (the Lord's Prayer); Desmond Tutu's Truth and Reconciliation Commission showed that forgiveness can heal a nation; reconciliation is central to Christian teaching. Islam — peace is a core value; "As-Salaam" (the Source of Peace) is one of the 99 Names of Allah; "whoever pardons and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allah" (Surah 42:40); Islamic Relief works in conflict zones worldwide. Both religions teach the sanctity of life and the importance of justice and mercy.
- **Arguments against:** Forgiveness without justice can allow injustice to continue — some argue accountability must come first; it may be unrealistic to forgive in cases of extreme violence (e.g. genocide, terrorism); non-religious humanists argue peace and reconciliation are important for practical, ethical reasons — not because God commands it; secular organisations (UN, Amnesty International) achieve peacemaking without religious motivation; religion has sometimes been used to fuel conflict, not resolve it
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view engaging with at least two perspectives
- **Level indicators:** L4 = developed arguments referencing both Christianity and Islam with specific teachings/scripture, engagement with non-religious views, justified conclusion. L1 = simple opinion from one perspective only

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "Can you talk me through the conditions of Just War theory? Do you think any modern wars would actually qualify?"
- "What's the difference between lesser jihad and greater jihad? Which one do you think matters more to most Muslims?"
- "Quakers say all violence is wrong, no matter what. But what if someone is attacking innocent people — is it right to do nothing? What would a Quaker say to that?"
- "Some people say nuclear weapons keep us safe because nobody would dare start a war. Others say they're too dangerous to exist. Where do you stand — and what would a Christian or Muslim say?"
- "I'm going to argue that forgiveness is weakness — if someone wrongs you, they should face consequences, not be forgiven. Challenge me using religious teachings."
- "Can you think of any examples where religion has actually helped bring about peace? And can you think of any where it has made conflict worse?"
- "Is it possible to be a soldier and a good Christian at the same time? What about a good Muslim?"
