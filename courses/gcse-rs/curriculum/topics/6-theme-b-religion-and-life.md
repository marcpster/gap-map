# 6. Theme B: Religion and Life

## Key Concepts

### 6.1 Origins of the Universe
- **Christian view:** "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" (Genesis 1:1); God created the world in six days and rested on the seventh
- Literalist Christians: Genesis is a factual account; the universe is thousands of years old (young earth creationism)
- Liberal Christians: Genesis is a metaphorical or symbolic account; compatible with science; God initiated the process
- **Islamic view:** Allah created the heavens and the earth; "He is the Originator of the heavens and the earth" (Surah 6:101)
- Surah 21:30 — "The heavens and the earth were a joined entity, and We separated them" — some Muslims see this as consistent with the Big Bang
- The Qur'an is not a science textbook but does not contradict established science; many Muslims accept scientific explanations alongside faith
- **Scientific view:** Big Bang theory — the universe began approximately 13.8 billion years ago from a singularity; supported by evidence (cosmic microwave background radiation, redshift)
- **Compatibility debate:** some see science and religion as complementary (God caused the Big Bang); others see them as conflicting (no need for God if science explains origins)

### 6.2 The Value of the World
- **Stewardship:** the belief that humans are caretakers of the world on God's behalf; responsibility to look after creation for future generations
- Christianity: "The Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and take care of it" (Genesis 2:15)
- Psalm 24:1 — "The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it"
- **Dominion:** "Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky" (Genesis 1:26) — sometimes misinterpreted as permission to exploit; most Christians interpret this as responsible authority
- **Islam:** Khalifah — humans are trustees (stewards) of Allah's creation; will be held accountable on the Day of Judgement for how they treated the earth
- Surah 2:29 — "It is He who created for you all that is on the earth" — creation is a gift, but comes with responsibility
- The earth is a trust (amanah) from Allah, not human property
- Non-religious views: the world has intrinsic value regardless of divine creation; environmental responsibility is a moral duty based on reason and the interests of future generations

### 6.3 Use and Abuse of the Environment
- **Pollution:** contamination of air, water, and land; contributes to climate change, health problems, and destruction of habitats
- **Deforestation:** clearing forests for farming, industry, or development; loss of biodiversity, increased carbon emissions, displacement of indigenous peoples
- **Natural resources:** fossil fuels, minerals, water — finite resources being consumed unsustainably
- Christianity: stewardship demands responsible use; many churches actively campaign on environmental issues (e.g. Pope Francis, Laudato Si', 2015)
- Islam: waste and excess are forbidden — "Eat and drink, but do not waste" (Surah 7:31); corruption of the land is condemned
- Surah 30:41 — "Corruption has appeared throughout the land and sea because of what the hands of people have earned"
- Non-religious views: environmental ethics based on sustainability, scientific evidence, and concern for future generations; organisations like Greenpeace and the UN push for action without religious motivation

### 6.4 Use and Abuse of Animals
- **Factory farming:** intensive farming for efficiency and profit; animals kept in confined, often cruel conditions; raises ethical concerns about suffering
- **Animal testing:** used in medical and cosmetic research; some argue it is necessary to save human lives; others say it causes unnecessary suffering
- **Vegetarianism and veganism:** ethical, environmental, and health reasons for avoiding meat; some religious traditions support it
- Christianity: animals are part of God's creation; humans have dominion but this includes care, not cruelty; "A righteous man cares for the needs of his animal" (Proverbs 12:10)
- Some Christians argue animal testing is acceptable if it saves human lives — humans are made in God's image and have greater value
- Islam: animals are communities like humans — "There is no creature on earth, nor any bird that flies with its wings, but they are communities like you" (Surah 6:38)
- Halal slaughter: animals must be treated with respect; slaughter must be swift and humane; a prayer (Bismillah) is said
- Islam forbids hunting for sport and causing unnecessary suffering to animals
- Non-religious views: utilitarian approach — minimise suffering overall; Peter Singer's animal rights philosophy — sentience, not species, determines moral worth; many non-religious people adopt vegetarianism or veganism on ethical grounds

### 6.5 Origins of Human Life
- **Evolution:** Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection; humans evolved over millions of years from common ancestors with other primates; supported by fossil evidence, DNA, and observation
- **Creationism:** God created humans directly; literalist reading of Genesis — Adam and Eve as the first humans
- **Intelligent design:** the complexity of life suggests a designer; not the same as creationism but implies divine involvement
- Christianity: range of views — some accept evolution as God's method of creation (theistic evolution); others hold to literal six-day creation
- "I knew you before I formed you in the womb" (Jeremiah 1:5) — God is involved in the creation of each person
- Islam: Allah created Adam from clay (Surah 15:26); many Muslims accept adaptation within species but not that humans descended from apes; others accept evolution as compatible with faith
- Non-religious views: evolution is the scientific consensus; no need for a divine explanation; human life is the result of natural processes

### 6.6 Abortion
- **Definition:** the deliberate termination of a pregnancy; legal in England, Scotland, and Wales up to 24 weeks under the Abortion Act 1967 (amended 1990); two doctors must agree
- **Sanctity of life:** the belief that all life is sacred because it is God-given; "Do not kill" (Exodus 20:13)
- "I knew you before I formed you in the womb" (Jeremiah 1:5) — life begins before birth; God has a plan for each person
- **Quality of life:** the idea that life should be worth living; sometimes used to justify abortion in cases of severe disability or hardship
- Christianity: Catholic — abortion is always wrong; life begins at conception; the embryo has full human rights from the moment of fertilisation
- Church of England: abortion is generally wrong but may be the lesser of two evils in some circumstances (e.g. risk to the mother's life, rape)
- Islam: most scholars say ensoulment occurs at 120 days (Hadith); abortion before this point may be permitted for serious reasons (e.g. mother's health); after 120 days it is generally forbidden
- Surah 5:32 — "Whoever kills a soul... it is as if he had slain all mankind"
- Surah 17:33 — "Do not take life which Allah has made sacred"
- Non-religious views: pro-choice — a woman has the right to decide what happens to her own body; bodily autonomy; situation ethics — the most loving outcome depends on circumstances; utilitarian — minimise suffering

### 6.7 Euthanasia
- **Active euthanasia:** deliberately ending someone's life to relieve suffering (e.g. lethal injection); illegal in the UK
- **Passive euthanasia:** withdrawing or withholding treatment, allowing someone to die naturally; can be legal in some circumstances
- **Voluntary euthanasia:** the person requests their own death; sometimes called "assisted dying"
- **Non-voluntary euthanasia:** the person cannot give consent (e.g. in a coma); decisions made by family or doctors
- **Sanctity of life:** life is a gift from God; only God has the right to take it away
- Christianity: Catholic — euthanasia is always wrong; life is sacred from conception to natural death; suffering can have redemptive value (uniting with Christ's suffering)
- Some Christians accept withdrawing treatment if there is no hope of recovery — "letting nature take its course" is not the same as killing
- Hospice movement: founded by Dame Cicely Saunders (a Christian); palliative care as an alternative to euthanasia
- Islam: life belongs to Allah, not to the individual; "Do not take life which Allah has made sacred" (Surah 17:33); euthanasia is haram (forbidden)
- Passive euthanasia: some Islamic scholars permit withdrawing treatment if death is inevitable and treatment is futile — this is not considered killing but accepting Allah's will
- Non-religious views: personal autonomy — people should have the right to choose when and how they die; quality of life matters more than quantity; utilitarian — if suffering outweighs benefit, ending life may be the compassionate choice; the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland offers assisted dying

## Common Misconceptions

- All religious people reject evolution (many Christians and Muslims accept evolution as compatible with faith — theistic evolution)
- The Big Bang theory disproves God (many believers see God as the cause of the Big Bang; science explains "how," religion explains "why")
- Dominion means humans can do whatever they want to the environment (most religious interpretations emphasise responsible stewardship, not exploitation)
- Islam forbids all abortion (abortion may be permitted before 120 days for serious reasons; views vary among scholars)
- Euthanasia and assisted suicide are the same thing (euthanasia involves someone else performing the act; assisted suicide provides the means for the person to end their own life)
- All Christians believe life begins at conception (the Church of England and other denominations have more nuanced positions)
- Religious teachings on animals mean religious people do not care about animal welfare (both Christianity and Islam have strong teachings on treating animals with kindness)

### Q1 — Origins of the universe
**Area:** 6.1 Origins of the universe
**Question:** "What is the Big Bang theory, and how do some religious believers respond to it?"
**Looking for:** Big Bang — the universe began from a singularity approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since. Religious responses: some see it as conflicting with Genesis/Qur'an (literalists); others see God as the cause of the Big Bang (compatible — God set it in motion). Bonus: mentions that Surah 21:30 has been interpreted as consistent with the Big Bang.

### Q2 — Stewardship and dominion
**Area:** 6.2 The value of the world
**Question:** "What is the difference between stewardship and dominion?"
**Looking for:** Stewardship is the idea that humans are caretakers of the world on God's behalf — responsibility to look after creation (Genesis 2:15). Dominion is the authority given to humans over creation (Genesis 1:26) — "rule over" the animals and earth. Key point: dominion does not mean exploitation; most Christians interpret it as responsible authority. Bonus: mentions Khalifah in Islam.

### Q3 — Use and abuse of animals
**Area:** 6.4 Use and abuse of animals
**Question:** "Explain two religious teachings about how animals should be treated."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Christianity — humans have dominion over animals but should care for them; "a righteous man cares for the needs of his animal" (Proverbs 12:10), (2) Islam — animals are "communities like you" (Surah 6:38); must be treated with respect; hunting for sport is forbidden, (3) halal slaughter requires the animal to be killed swiftly with minimal suffering, (4) animal testing may be acceptable if it saves human lives — humans have greater value as they are made in God's image. Each teaching stated and developed.

### Q4 — Abortion
**Area:** 6.6 Abortion
**Question:** "Explain two different religious attitudes to abortion."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Catholic — always wrong; life begins at conception; "Do not kill" (Exodus 20:13); the embryo has full human rights, (2) Church of England — generally wrong but may be the lesser of two evils in some circumstances (e.g. risk to the mother, rape), (3) Islam — ensoulment at 120 days (Hadith); abortion may be permitted before this for serious reasons; after ensoulment it is generally forbidden; "Do not take life which Allah has made sacred" (Surah 17:33). Each attitude clearly stated with reasoning and development.

### Q5 — Euthanasia
**Area:** 6.7 Euthanasia
**Question:** "Explain two religious teachings about euthanasia. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two from: (1) Catholic — euthanasia is always wrong; life is sacred from conception to natural death; suffering can have redemptive value, (2) Islam — life belongs to Allah; euthanasia is haram; "Do not take life which Allah has made sacred" (Surah 17:33), (3) some Christians accept withdrawing treatment if there is no hope of recovery — not the same as actively killing, (4) hospice movement as a Christian alternative — palliative care to relieve suffering without ending life. Must include a source — e.g. Exodus 20:13, Surah 17:33, or relevant teaching. Development should explain significance.

### Q6 — Origins and science
**Area:** 6.1 / 6.5 Origins of the universe and human life
**Question:** "Science has made it impossible to believe in a creator God. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** the Big Bang explains the origin of the universe without needing God; evolution explains human life through natural selection; fossil and DNA evidence supports science, not creation stories; there is no empirical evidence for God
- **Arguments against:** science explains "how" but not "why" — religion answers a different question; many scientists are religious (e.g. Francis Collins); Genesis can be read metaphorically — compatible with science; the Big Bang still needs a first cause (cosmological argument); "I knew you before I formed you in the womb" (Jeremiah 1:5) suggests a personal God beyond scientific explanation
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view that engages with both sides
- **Level indicators:** L4 = multiple developed arguments from both sides with specific references to science and religious teaching, awareness of different interpretations (literal vs liberal), justified conclusion; L1 = simple assertion without reasoning

### Q7 — Sanctity of life — cross-religious evaluation
**Area:** 6.6 / 6.7 Abortion and euthanasia
**Question:** "People should always have the right to decide when to end a life. Discuss this statement. You should refer to Christianity, Islam, and non-religious views such as atheism or humanism in your answer."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** non-religious views — personal autonomy is a fundamental right; a woman should have control over her own body (pro-choice); people suffering with terminal illness should be allowed to die with dignity; quality of life matters more than quantity; utilitarian argument — minimise suffering; situation ethics — the most loving thing depends on the circumstances
- **Arguments against:** Christianity — sanctity of life; "Do not kill" (Exodus 20:13); life is a gift from God, not ours to take; "I knew you before I formed you in the womb" (Jeremiah 1:5); Catholic teaching — life sacred from conception to natural death; Islam — life belongs to Allah; "Do not take life which Allah has made sacred" (Surah 17:33); Surah 5:32 — killing one soul is like killing all mankind; only Allah decides when life ends; hospice care and palliative medicine offer alternatives to euthanasia
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view that weighs personal autonomy against religious conviction about the sanctity of life; engages with at least two religions and a non-religious perspective
- **Level indicators:** L4 = balanced arguments drawing on Christianity, Islam, and non-religious views with specific teachings, scripture, and developed reasoning across both abortion and euthanasia, justified conclusion; L1 = one-sided opinion without religious or non-religious reference

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "If science can explain how the universe began, do we still need God? What would a Christian and a Muslim each say?"
- "What's the difference between stewardship and dominion? Can you think of examples where humans have got it wrong?"
- "Is it ever right to test medicines on animals if it could save human lives? What would a religious person say versus someone with no religion?"
- "I'm going to argue that abortion is always a woman's right and nobody else's business — what would a Catholic say back to me?"
- "If God is omnipotent, why doesn't He just stop suffering instead of expecting people to endure it? Does that change how you think about euthanasia?"
- "A literalist Christian and a scientist sit down to discuss the origins of the universe — how does that conversation go? Is there any common ground?"
- "Some people say 'sanctity of life' is just a way of controlling people's choices. Do you agree, or is there genuine value in that principle?"
