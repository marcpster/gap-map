# 5. Theme A: Relationships and Families

## Key Concepts

### 5.1 Sexual Relationships
- **Fornication:** sex before marriage — most Christians and Muslims teach this is wrong; the body is sacred
- **Adultery:** sex outside marriage — condemned in both religions; breaks trust and the marriage covenant
- Christianity: "The two shall become one flesh" (Mark 10:8) — sex belongs within marriage
- Catholic teaching: sex has two purposes — unitive (bonding) and procreative (creating life); both must be present
- Liberal Christians: may accept sex before marriage within a loving, committed relationship
- Islam: sex is a gift from Allah, but only permitted within marriage (nikah); Zina (unlawful sexual relations) is a major sin
- Surah 17:32 — "Do not approach unlawful sexual intercourse"
- Non-religious views: personal autonomy and consent are the key factors, not marital status

### 5.2 Contraception
- **Catholic view:** artificial contraception is wrong (Humanae Vitae, 1968); interferes with God's plan for procreation; only natural family planning (NFP) permitted
- **Other Christian views:** many Protestants accept contraception within marriage; responsible family planning is good stewardship
- Church of England: accepted contraception since 1930 (Lambeth Conference)
- **Islam:** generally permitted within marriage if both partners agree; some scholars prefer natural methods
- Hadith: the Prophet knew of withdrawal (azl) and did not forbid it
- Permanent contraception (e.g. sterilisation) is generally discouraged unless medically necessary — children are a blessing from Allah
- Non-religious views: contraception is a matter of personal choice; promotes sexual health and prevents unwanted pregnancies

### 5.3 Marriage
- **Nature and purpose:** a lifelong commitment between two people; provides stability for raising children, companionship, and sexual expression within a moral framework
- Christianity: marriage is a sacrament (Catholic) or a covenant before God (Protestant)
- "What God has joined together, let no one separate" (Mark 10:9)
- Genesis 2:24 — "A man leaves his father and mother and is united to his wife"
- Ephesians 5:22–33 — mutual love and sacrifice; husbands to love wives as Christ loved the Church
- **Islam:** marriage (nikah) is a contract, not a sacrament; includes a mahr (dowry) given by the groom to the bride
- Surah 30:21 — "He created for you mates from among yourselves, that you may dwell in tranquillity with them, and He has put love and mercy between your hearts"
- Hadith: "Marriage is half of faith"
- Surah 4:3 — polygyny permitted (up to four wives) but only if the husband can treat them all equally; most scholars say this is virtually impossible
- **Inter-faith marriage:** Christians generally discouraged from marrying outside the faith; Catholic Church requires a dispensation; Islam permits Muslim men to marry "People of the Book" (Christians and Jews) but Muslim women are traditionally expected to marry Muslim men
- **Same-sex marriage:** legalised in England and Wales (2013); most traditional Christian and Islamic teaching opposes it; some liberal Christians affirm it

### 5.4 Divorce and Remarriage
- Christianity: "What God has joined together, let no one separate" (Mark 10:9) — marriage intended to be permanent
- **Catholic view:** marriage cannot be dissolved; divorce is not recognised; annulment declares the marriage was never valid (e.g. lack of consent, inability to consummate)
- **Protestant views:** most accept divorce as a last resort; some denominations permit remarriage in church
- Jesus allowed divorce for "marital unfaithfulness" (Matthew 19:9)
- **Islam:** divorce (talaq) is permitted but is "the most disliked of all permitted things" (Hadith)
- Process: a waiting period (iddah) of three menstrual cycles to ensure the wife is not pregnant and to allow reconciliation
- Surah 2:228 — women have rights similar to those over them in kindness; both partners have rights in divorce
- Khul: a wife can initiate divorce by returning the mahr
- Remarriage is permitted in Islam after divorce
- Non-religious views: divorce is a personal decision; no moral stigma; focus on the wellbeing of those involved, especially children

### 5.5 The Nature and Purpose of Families
- **Types:** nuclear (parents and children), extended (including grandparents, aunts, uncles), single-parent, blended/step-families, same-sex parent families
- **Purposes:** procreation (having children), stability and security, educating children in faith and morals, mutual support
- Christianity: children are a gift from God; parents have a duty to raise them in the faith; the family is the foundation of society
- "Children are a heritage from the Lord" (Psalm 127:3)
- Islam: the family (including extended family) is the foundation of the Ummah; parents must raise children to follow Islam
- Respect for parents is a duty: "Your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him, and that you be kind to parents" (Surah 17:23)
- Non-religious views: families come in many forms; what matters is love, stability, and the welfare of children, not the structure

### 5.6 Gender Equality
- **Traditional Christian views:** men and women have different but complementary roles; men lead, women nurture
- Ephesians 5:22 — "Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands" — often quoted but context includes mutual submission
- Galatians 3:28 — "There is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus"
- Catholic Church: women cannot be ordained as priests; role of Mary as a model of faith
- Church of England: ordained women priests (1994) and bishops (2015)
- **Islam:** men and women are spiritually equal before Allah but have different roles and responsibilities
- Surah 4:34 — men are "protectors and maintainers" of women; debated interpretation
- Women have rights to education, property, and inheritance (Surah 4:7) — revolutionary at the time of revelation
- Some Muslim-majority countries restrict women's roles; others have had female heads of state
- Non-religious views: full equality regardless of gender; traditional religious roles are seen as outdated and discriminatory
- Secular feminism: gender roles are social constructs, not divinely ordained

## Common Misconceptions

- Islam allows men to marry as many wives as they want (the Qur'an limits it to four and requires equal treatment, which most scholars say is practically impossible)
- All Christians are against divorce (Catholic teaching opposes it, but many Protestant denominations accept it as a last resort)
- Contraception is banned in all of Christianity (only the Catholic Church prohibits artificial contraception; most Protestants accept it)
- Islamic divorce means a man just says "I divorce you" three times (the process includes a waiting period for reconciliation, and women can also initiate divorce through khul)
- Religious people are always against gender equality (many use scripture to argue for equality — e.g. Galatians 3:28)
- Arranged marriages and forced marriages are the same thing (arranged marriages involve family introductions with the consent of both parties; forced marriage is condemned by both religions and is illegal in the UK)

### Q1 — Sexual relationships
**Area:** 5.1 Sexual relationships
**Question:** "What is the difference between fornication and adultery?"
**Looking for:** Fornication is sex before marriage; adultery is sex outside marriage (i.e. when at least one person is already married to someone else). Both are considered sinful in Christianity and Islam. Bonus: can explain why — the body is sacred, sex belongs within marriage.

### Q2 — Contraception
**Area:** 5.2 Contraception
**Question:** "What is the Catholic Church's teaching on contraception, and how does it differ from other Christian views?"
**Looking for:** Catholic Church teaches that artificial contraception is wrong (Humanae Vitae); only natural family planning is permitted; sex must be both unitive and procreative. Other Christians (e.g. Church of England) accept contraception within marriage as responsible family planning. Bonus: mentions that Islam generally permits contraception within marriage.

### Q3 — Marriage
**Area:** 5.3 Marriage
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why marriage is important in either Christianity or Islam."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) lifelong commitment/covenant before God — provides stability and faithfulness, (2) the proper context for sexual relationships and having children, (3) companionship and mutual support — "the two shall become one flesh" (Mark 10:8) or Surah 30:21 on love and mercy, (4) a sacrament (Catholic) or fulfilling half of faith (Islam — Hadith). Each point stated and developed.

### Q4 — Divorce and remarriage
**Area:** 5.4 Divorce and remarriage
**Question:** "Explain two different religious attitudes to divorce."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Catholic — marriage is permanent, divorce not recognised, only annulment; "What God has joined together, let no one separate" (Mark 10:9), (2) Protestant — most accept divorce as a last resort; Jesus allowed it for unfaithfulness (Matthew 19:9); some permit remarriage, (3) Islam — divorce is permitted but disliked ("the most disliked of all permitted things"); involves a waiting period (iddah) for reconciliation; both men and women can initiate it. Each attitude clearly stated with reasoning.

### Q5 — The nature and purpose of families
**Area:** 5.5 The nature and purpose of families
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why the family is important in religious teaching. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two from: (1) procreation — children are a gift from God; duty to raise them in the faith, (2) stability — providing a secure environment for children to grow, (3) moral and religious education — passing on values and beliefs to the next generation, (4) mutual support and love — reflecting God's love. Must include a source — e.g. "Children are a heritage from the Lord" (Psalm 127:3), Surah 17:23 on kindness to parents, or Genesis 2:24. Development should explain significance.

### Q6 — Gender equality
**Area:** 5.6 Gender equality
**Question:** "Religion treats men and women as equal. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** Galatians 3:28 — "there is neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus"; women ordained in Church of England; Islam teaches spiritual equality before Allah; women have rights to education, property, and inheritance in Islam (Surah 4:7)
- **Arguments against:** Catholic Church does not ordain women; Ephesians 5:22 — "wives, submit to your husbands"; Surah 4:34 — men as "protectors and maintainers"; traditional roles assign leadership to men in both religions; some religious communities restrict women's participation
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view that engages with both sides
- **Level indicators:** L4 = multiple developed arguments from both sides with specific teachings/scripture, awareness that views vary within religions, justified conclusion; L1 = simple assertion without evidence

### Q7 — Marriage and divorce — cross-religious evaluation
**Area:** 5.3 / 5.4 Marriage and divorce
**Question:** "There is no good reason to stay in an unhappy marriage. Discuss this statement. You should refer to Christianity, Islam, and non-religious views such as atheism or humanism in your answer."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** staying in an unhappy marriage can cause emotional harm to both partners and children; non-religious view — personal happiness and wellbeing matter more than a legal contract; secular humanism prioritises human flourishing; divorce is legal and socially accepted; some marriages involve abuse or neglect
- **Arguments against:** Christianity — "What God has joined together, let no one separate" (Mark 10:9); marriage is a sacred covenant/sacrament, not just about happiness; Catholic teaching — marriage is permanent; Islam — divorce is "the most disliked of all permitted things" (Hadith); marriage provides stability for children; both religions encourage reconciliation before divorce; commitment means enduring difficulty, not just leaving when it gets hard
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view that weighs religious commitment against personal wellbeing; engages with at least two religions and a non-religious perspective
- **Level indicators:** L4 = balanced arguments drawing on Christianity, Islam, and non-religious views with specific teachings and developed reasoning, justified conclusion; L1 = one-sided opinion without religious or non-religious reference

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "What do you think is the main purpose of marriage — is it about love, commitment, having children, or something else?"
- "Why do you think the Catholic Church won't allow divorce, even when a marriage has completely broken down? Do you think that's fair?"
- "Islam says divorce is permitted but disliked. What do you think that means in practice — is it helpful or does it just make people feel guilty?"
- "I'm going to argue that religion is inherently sexist — convince me otherwise."
- "Do you think it matters whether a couple is married before they have children? What would a Christian, a Muslim, and a humanist each say?"
- "If contraception prevents unwanted pregnancies and the suffering that can cause, why would any religion oppose it?"
- "Can you have a genuinely equal relationship if your religion teaches that men and women have different roles?"
