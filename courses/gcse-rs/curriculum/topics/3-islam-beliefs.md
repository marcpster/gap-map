# 3. Islam: Beliefs and Teachings

## Key Concepts

### 3.1 The Six Articles of Faith (Sunni) and Five Roots of Usul ad-Din (Shi'a)
- **Sunni — Six Articles of Faith:** belief in Allah, angels, holy books, prophets, the Day of Judgement, predestination (al-Qadr)
- **Shi'a — Five Roots of Usul ad-Din:** Tawhid (oneness of God), Adalat (justice of God), Nubuwwah (prophethood), Imamate (authority of the Imams), Mi'ad (Day of Judgement)
- Both Sunni and Shi'a agree on core beliefs but differ on authority and leadership after Muhammad

### 3.2 Tawhid — Oneness of God
- The most fundamental belief in Islam: there is one God (Allah), unique and indivisible
- Shirk (associating partners with God) is the greatest sin
- Surah 112 (Al-Ikhlas): "Say, He is Allah, the One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent."
- Surah 1 (Al-Fatihah): "In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"
- 99 Names of Allah describe his attributes (e.g. Al-Rahman — the Merciful, Al-Adl — the Just)

### 3.3 Angels (Malaikah)
- Created by Allah from light; have no free will — carry out God's commands
- **Jibril (Gabriel):** revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad; the most important angel
- **Mika'il (Michael):** responsible for providing sustenance and rain
- **Israfil:** will blow the trumpet on the Day of Judgement
- **Izra'il:** the Angel of Death
- Angels are unseen but Muslims must believe in them

### 3.4 Predestination (Al-Qadr)
- Allah knows everything that has happened and will happen — omniscient
- Everything that occurs is part of Allah's plan
- Tension: if God has predetermined everything, do humans have free will?
- Muslim view: humans have free will to choose their actions but God knows their choices in advance
- "Nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed for us" (Surah 9:51)
- On the Day of Judgement, humans are accountable for their choices

### 3.5 Akhirah — Life After Death
- Belief in the Day of Judgement (Yawm al-Din) — all will be raised and judged
- Barzakh: the state between death and judgement
- The scales (Mizan): good and bad deeds weighed
- Al-Jannah (paradise): gardens of eternal bliss; reward for the righteous
- Jahannam (hell): punishment for the wicked; described with fire imagery
- "Whoever does an atom's weight of good will see it, and whoever does an atom's weight of evil will see it" (Surah 99:7–8)
- Belief in akhirah motivates Muslims to live moral lives

### 3.6 Prophethood (Risalah)
- Prophets are messengers chosen by Allah to guide humanity
- **Adam:** the first prophet and first human
- **Ibrahim (Abraham):** submitted to God's will; prepared to sacrifice his son; father of monotheism
- **Musa (Moses):** received the Torah; led the Israelites
- **Isa (Jesus):** a prophet in Islam (not the Son of God); born of a virgin; performed miracles
- **Muhammad:** the Seal of the Prophets — the final and most important prophet
- Muhammad received the Qur'an through Jibril over 23 years; his life (Sunnah) is a model for Muslims

### 3.7 The Holy Books
- **Qur'an:** the literal, unchanged word of Allah, revealed to Muhammad in Arabic; the supreme authority
- **Torah (Tawrat):** given to Musa; Muslims believe the original was God's word but it has been altered
- **Psalms (Zabur):** given to Dawud (David)
- **Gospels (Injil):** given to Isa; Muslims believe the original message was from God but has been changed
- **Hadith:** collections of Muhammad's sayings, actions, and approvals — second most important source after the Qur'an
- **Sunnah:** Muhammad's way of life and example; guides Muslim behaviour

## Common Misconceptions

- Islam is a new religion (Muslims trace their faith back through Ibrahim to Adam)
- Jihad means "holy war" (greater jihad is the internal spiritual struggle; lesser jihad has strict conditions — see Topic 4)
- Muslims worship Muhammad (they worship Allah alone; Muhammad is a prophet, not divine)
- The Qur'an is a version of the Bible (Muslims believe it is a completely separate, direct revelation from God)
- Predestination means Muslims are fatalistic (they believe in free will alongside God's knowledge)
- Sunni and Shi'a have completely different beliefs (they share core beliefs; the split is primarily about authority/leadership)
- Muslims believe Jesus never existed (they honour him as a major prophet — just not as Son of God)

### Q1 — Tawhid
**Area:** 3.2 Tawhid
**Question:** "What does Tawhid mean, and why is it the most important belief in Islam?"
**Looking for:** Tawhid = the oneness of God. Allah is one, unique, indivisible. It is the foundation of everything in Islam — the Shahadah declares it. Shirk (associating anything with God) is the worst sin. May reference Surah 112.

### Q2 — Angels
**Area:** 3.3 Angels
**Question:** "Name two angels in Islam and say what their role is."
**Looking for:** Any two from: Jibril — revealed the Qur'an to Muhammad; Mika'il — provides sustenance/rain; Israfil — will blow the trumpet on the Day of Judgement; Izra'il — the Angel of Death. Correct name + correct role.

### Q3 — Prophethood
**Area:** 3.6 Prophethood
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why Muhammad is considered the most important prophet in Islam."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) the Seal of the Prophets — the final messenger, completing God's revelation, (2) received the Qur'an — the unchanged word of Allah, (3) his Sunnah is a model for how Muslims should live, (4) he established the Muslim community (Ummah). Each point stated and then developed.

### Q4 — Akhirah
**Area:** 3.5 Akhirah
**Question:** "Explain two Muslim beliefs about what happens after death."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Day of Judgement — all raised and judged by Allah, (2) the scales (Mizan) — good and bad deeds weighed, (3) Al-Jannah — paradise for the righteous, (4) Jahannam — hell for the wicked, (5) Barzakh — waiting state between death and judgement. Development explains significance — e.g. motivates Muslims to live morally.

### Q5 — Sunni and Shi'a beliefs
**Area:** 3.1 Six Articles / Five Roots
**Question:** "Explain two differences between Sunni and Shi'a beliefs. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two from: (1) Sunni follow Six Articles of Faith, Shi'a follow Five Roots of Usul ad-Din, (2) Shi'a believe in the Imamate — divinely appointed leaders after Muhammad (starting with Ali), Sunni follow elected caliphs, (3) Shi'a include Adalat (justice of God) as a separate root, (4) Shi'a have Ten Obligatory Acts vs Sunni Five Pillars. Must include a source — e.g. Qur'anic reference, Hadith, or authoritative teaching.

### Q6 — Predestination and free will
**Area:** 3.4 Predestination
**Question:** "If Allah already knows everything that will happen, humans cannot really have free will. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** Allah is omniscient — knows every choice before it is made; "nothing will happen to us except what Allah has decreed" (Surah 9:51); if everything is predetermined, choices are an illusion
- **Arguments against:** Muslims believe Allah gave humans free will to choose between right and wrong; on the Day of Judgement humans are held accountable — unfair if they had no choice; knowing what someone will do is not the same as making them do it; the Qur'an commands right action — pointless if humans cannot choose
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view engaging with both sides
- **Level indicators:** L4 = developed arguments from both perspectives with Qur'anic references, justified conclusion; L1 = simple opinion

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "Can you explain Tawhid to me? Why do Muslims say shirk is the worst possible sin?"
- "What's the difference between how Muslims and Christians view Jesus?"
- "If the Qur'an, Torah, Psalms, and Gospels all come from God, why do Muslims say the Qur'an is different?"
- "I'm going to argue that if God already knows what you'll do, it's pointless to try to be good — convince me otherwise."
- "Why does it matter to Muslims that Muhammad was the last prophet? What difference does 'the Seal of the Prophets' actually make?"
- "How does belief in akhirah affect how a Muslim lives their daily life?"
