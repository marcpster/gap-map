# 4. Islam: Practices

## Key Concepts

### 4.1 The Five Pillars (Sunni)
- **Shahadah:** declaration of faith — "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah"
- **Salah:** five daily prayers (Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha)
- **Zakah:** giving 2.5% of annual savings to those in need
- **Sawm:** fasting during the month of Ramadan
- **Hajj:** pilgrimage to Makkah at least once in a lifetime (if able)
- The Five Pillars are the foundation of Muslim life; they demonstrate submission to Allah

### 4.2 The Ten Obligatory Acts (Shi'a)
- Include the Five Pillars plus additional obligations:
- **Khums:** 20% tax on surplus income (in addition to Zakah)
- **Jihad:** striving in the way of Allah (greater and lesser)
- **Amr bil Maruf:** enjoining good
- **Nahi anil Munkar:** forbidding evil
- **Tawallah:** expressing love towards good
- **Tabarra:** disassociating from evil

### 4.3 Salah — Prayer
- Five daily prayers facing Makkah (the Qiblah)
- Wudu: ritual washing before prayer (hands, face, arms, feet)
- Rak'ahs: set sequences of movements (standing, bowing, prostrating)
- Jummah: congregational Friday prayers at the mosque; includes a sermon (khutbah)
- Prayer mat and modest clothing; men and women pray separately
- "Establish prayer, for prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds" (Surah 29:45)

### 4.4 Sawm — Fasting
- Fasting from dawn (Suhoor) to sunset (Iftar) during Ramadan — no food, drink, smoking, or sexual relations
- Ramadan: the month the Qur'an was first revealed to Muhammad
- Exemptions: children, elderly, pregnant/nursing women, travellers, those who are ill
- Laylat al-Qadr (Night of Power): the night the Qur'an was first revealed; better than a thousand months (Surah 97:3)
- Purpose: self-discipline, empathy with the poor, spiritual focus, gratitude

### 4.5 Zakah and Khums
- **Zakah:** 2.5% of annual savings given to those in need; one of the Five Pillars
- Purifies wealth; a duty, not charity
- Recipients include the poor, debtors, travellers, and those working to collect it
- **Khums (Shi'a):** 20% of surplus income; divided between descendants of Muhammad and the poor
- "Take from their wealth a charity by which you purify them" (Surah 9:103)

### 4.6 Hajj — Pilgrimage
- Annual pilgrimage to Makkah during Dhul Hijjah (12th month of Islamic calendar)
- Required once in a lifetime for every Muslim who is physically and financially able
- Key rituals:
  - **Ihram:** white garments symbolising equality before God
  - **Tawaf:** circling the Ka'bah seven times
  - **Sa'y:** walking between the hills of Safa and Marwah (remembering Hagar's search for water)
  - **Arafat:** standing on the plain of Arafat (Day of Arafat); the most important part of Hajj
  - **Mina:** stoning the Jamarat (three pillars representing the devil)
- Significance: unity of the Ummah, forgiveness of sins, following Ibrahim's example

### 4.7 Jihad
- **Greater jihad:** the personal, spiritual struggle to live as a good Muslim — resisting temptation, studying the Qur'an, being kind
- Greater jihad is considered the more important struggle by most Muslims
- **Lesser jihad:** armed struggle to defend Islam; has strict conditions:
  - Must be a last resort
  - Must be declared by a religious authority
  - Must not harm civilians, trees, or buildings
  - Must stop when the enemy asks for peace
- "The best jihad is the word of justice in front of the oppressive ruler" (Hadith)

### 4.8 Festivals
- **Eid ul-Fitr:** celebrates the end of Ramadan; communal prayers, charity (Zakat ul-Fitr), feasting, visiting family
- **Eid ul-Adha:** during Hajj; commemorates Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son; animal sacrifice, meat shared with the poor
- **Ashura:** 10th of Muharram; Sunni fast to commemorate Musa's (Moses') deliverance; for Shi'a, marks the martyrdom of Husayn at Karbala — day of mourning

## Common Misconceptions

- Jihad means "holy war" (it primarily means spiritual struggle; armed jihad has strict conditions and is a last resort)
- Zakah is optional charity (it is a compulsory pillar of Islam — a duty, not a choice)
- All Muslims fast in exactly the same way (there are exemptions, and Shi'a practices include additional obligations)
- Women are not allowed to go on Hajj (women can and do perform Hajj; historically needed a male guardian, but this has been relaxed in Saudi Arabia)
- Ramadan is just about not eating (it includes spiritual reflection, extra prayer, Qur'an reading, charity)
- Sunni and Shi'a celebrate the same festivals in the same way (Ashura has very different significance)
- Wudu is just washing hands (it is a specific ritual sequence with spiritual significance — preparation for standing before God)

### Q1 — The Five Pillars
**Area:** 4.1 The Five Pillars
**Question:** "Name the Five Pillars of Islam."
**Looking for:** Shahadah (declaration of faith), Salah (prayer), Zakah (charitable giving), Sawm (fasting), Hajj (pilgrimage). All five named. Bonus: can say what each one means.

### Q2 — Salah
**Area:** 4.3 Salah
**Question:** "How do Muslims prepare for prayer, and why is that preparation important?"
**Looking for:** Wudu — ritual washing of hands, face, arms, feet. Important because: shows respect/reverence when standing before God, symbolises spiritual purification/cleanliness, required before prayer is valid. May mention facing Makkah (Qiblah), prayer mat.

### Q3 — Sawm and Ramadan
**Area:** 4.4 Sawm
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why fasting during Ramadan is important to Muslims."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) self-discipline and spiritual focus — getting closer to Allah, (2) empathy with the poor — understanding what it is like to go without, (3) Ramadan is when the Qur'an was first revealed — fasting marks this special month, (4) obedience — it is a Pillar of Islam, a direct command, (5) community — breaking fast together (Iftar) strengthens the Ummah. Each point stated and developed.

### Q4 — Hajj
**Area:** 4.6 Hajj
**Question:** "Explain two ways Hajj rituals are significant for Muslims."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Ihram — white garments show equality before Allah, strips away wealth and status, (2) Tawaf — circling the Ka'bah shows devotion to Allah and unity, (3) Arafat — standing in prayer, seeking forgiveness; the most important part of Hajj, (4) stoning the Jamarat — symbolises rejecting the devil/temptation, following Ibrahim's example. Each ritual named with its significance explained.

### Q5 — Zakah and Khums
**Area:** 4.5 Zakah and Khums
**Question:** "Explain two differences between Zakah and Khums. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two from: (1) Zakah is 2.5% of savings, Khums is 20% of surplus income — significantly more, (2) Zakah is a Sunni and Shi'a obligation (one of the Five Pillars), Khums is specifically a Shi'a obligation (one of the Ten Obligatory Acts), (3) Zakah goes to the poor, debtors, travellers etc., Khums is split between descendants of Muhammad and the poor. Must include a source — e.g. "Take from their wealth a charity by which you purify them" (Surah 9:103) or relevant Hadith.

### Q6 — Jihad
**Area:** 4.7 Jihad
**Question:** "Jihad is only about fighting and violence. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for (the misconception):** Lesser jihad does involve armed struggle; historically used to defend and spread Islam; media often portrays jihad as violent extremism
- **Arguments against:** Greater jihad is the personal spiritual struggle — resisting temptation, studying the Qur'an, being charitable; considered by most Muslims as the more important form; lesser jihad has strict conditions (last resort, no civilians, must stop when enemy seeks peace); "the best jihad is the word of justice in front of the oppressive ruler" (Hadith)
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view that engages with both sides
- **Level indicators:** L4 = distinguishes greater/lesser jihad with evidence, explains conditions of lesser jihad, reaches justified conclusion; L1 = simple assertion

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "Can you talk me through the Five Pillars? Which one do you think would be hardest to follow, and why?"
- "What's the point of wudu? Is it just about being clean, or is there more to it?"
- "Why would someone fast for an entire month? What does Ramadan actually achieve beyond not eating?"
- "I'm going to argue that jihad is just an excuse for violence — make the case that I'm wrong."
- "If Hajj is about equality before God, why does it cost thousands of pounds to go? Doesn't that defeat the point?"
- "What's the difference between Zakah and just giving money to charity? Does it matter that it's compulsory?"
