# 1. Christianity: Beliefs and Teachings

## Key Concepts

### 1.1 The Nature of God
- God is omnipotent (all-powerful), omnibenevolent (all-loving), and just (fair)
- God is both transcendent (beyond the physical world) and immanent (active in the world)
- "God is love" (1 John 4:8)
- The problem of evil: how can God be omnipotent and omnibenevolent if suffering exists?

### 1.2 The Trinity
- One God, three persons: Father, Son (Jesus), Holy Spirit
- Not three gods — monotheism with three aspects
- The Nicene Creed affirms Trinitarian belief
- Father as Creator, Son as Redeemer, Holy Spirit as Sustainer
- "Go and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Matthew 28:19)

### 1.3 Creation
- Genesis 1–3: God created the world in six days, rested on the seventh
- "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth" (Genesis 1:1)
- The Word (Logos) was present at creation — "In the beginning was the Word" (John 1:1)
- The Holy Spirit "was hovering over the waters" (Genesis 1:2)
- Literalist vs liberal interpretations of creation
- Stewardship: humans given responsibility to care for creation
- Dominion: "Rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky" (Genesis 1:26)

### 1.4 The Incarnation
- Jesus is God in human form — "the Word became flesh" (John 1:14)
- Born of the Virgin Mary — conceived by the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35)
- Fully God and fully human (Chalcedonian Definition)
- Shows God's love and desire to be close to humanity

### 1.5 The Crucifixion
- Jesus was crucified at Calvary under Pontius Pilate
- Atonement: Jesus died to pay the price for human sin
- "For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son" (John 3:16)
- Significance: restores the relationship between God and humanity broken by sin

### 1.6 The Resurrection and Ascension
- Jesus rose from the dead on the third day (the Gospels)
- The empty tomb discovered by Mary Magdalene and other women
- Appeared to disciples over 40 days (Acts 1:3)
- Ascended into heaven — "taken up before their very eyes" (Acts 1:9)
- Significance: proves Jesus is the Son of God, gives Christians hope of eternal life

### 1.7 Afterlife and Judgement
- Heaven: eternal life in God's presence
- Hell: separation from God; debated whether literal fire or spiritual anguish
- Purgatory (Catholic belief): a state of purification before heaven
- Resurrection of the body vs immortality of the soul
- Parable of the Sheep and Goats (Matthew 25:31–46): judgement based on how people treat others
- "Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me" (Matthew 25:40)

### 1.8 Sin and Salvation
- Original sin: inherited from Adam and Eve's disobedience (the Fall)
- Salvation through grace — a gift from God, not earned
- "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith" (Ephesians 2:8)
- Salvation through faith (Protestant emphasis) vs faith and works (Catholic emphasis)
- The role of the Holy Spirit in guiding Christians towards salvation
- Law and grace: the Ten Commandments vs the new covenant through Jesus

## Common Misconceptions

- The Trinity means Christians believe in three gods (it is one God in three persons — monotheism)
- All Christians interpret Genesis literally (many accept scientific accounts alongside scripture)
- The Incarnation means Jesus was not really human (orthodox teaching is fully God and fully human)
- Salvation is only about going to heaven (it also includes transformation of life now)
- All Christians believe in purgatory (it is a specifically Catholic doctrine)
- The Crucifixion was a failure that God then had to fix (Christians believe it was part of God's plan)
- The Resurrection is the same as resuscitation (it is transformation to a new kind of existence)

### Q1 — The Trinity
**Area:** 1.2 The Trinity
**Question:** "Christians say they believe in one God, but they also talk about the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. What do they actually mean by the Trinity?"
**Looking for:** One God, three persons. Not three separate gods — monotheism. Father (Creator), Son (Jesus/Redeemer), Holy Spirit (Sustainer/guide). The three are distinct but inseparable.

### Q2 — Creation and stewardship
**Area:** 1.3 Creation
**Question:** "What does the Bible say about how the world was created, and what responsibility does that give humans?"
**Looking for:** Genesis 1 — God created in six days. Humans made in God's image. Given dominion over creation but also stewardship — responsibility to look after it, not exploit it. Bonus: mentions the role of the Word/Spirit in creation.

### Q3 — The Incarnation
**Area:** 1.4 The Incarnation
**Question:** "Explain two reasons why the Incarnation is important to Christians."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) shows God's love for humanity by becoming human, (2) Jesus can understand human suffering because he experienced it, (3) makes salvation possible — God entering the world to save it, (4) fulfils Old Testament prophecy. Each point should be stated and then developed/explained.

### Q4 — Crucifixion and atonement
**Area:** 1.5 The Crucifixion
**Question:** "Explain two ways the Crucifixion is significant for Christians."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) atonement — Jesus died to pay for human sin, (2) shows the depth of God's love — sacrificing his Son, (3) restores relationship between God and humanity, (4) inspires Christians to self-sacrifice and service. Development might include scripture (John 3:16) or connecting to other beliefs.

### Q5 — Afterlife and judgement
**Area:** 1.7 Afterlife and judgement
**Question:** "Explain two Christian teachings about what happens after death. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two teachings from: heaven, hell, purgatory (Catholic), resurrection of the body, judgement. Must include a specific reference — Sheep and Goats (Matthew 25), "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25), or similar. Development should explain significance, not just name the teaching.

### Q6 — Sin, salvation, and the nature of God
**Area:** 1.8 / 1.1
**Question:** "If God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there's no need for humans to do anything good — God can just save everyone. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** God is all-powerful so could save everyone; grace means salvation is a gift not earned (Ephesians 2:8); some Christians believe in universal salvation
- **Arguments against:** Free will means humans must choose to follow God; faith without works is dead (James 2:17); the Sheep and Goats parable judges on actions; God is just as well as loving — justice requires accountability
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view that engages with the arguments
- **Level indicators:** L4 = multiple developed arguments from both sides with specific teachings/references, justified conclusion; L1 = simple opinion without reasoning

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "Can you explain the Trinity to me without making it sound like three separate gods?"
- "If God is all-powerful and all-loving, why does suffering exist? How do Christians deal with that?"
- "What's the difference between dominion and stewardship? Which do you think matters more for how Christians treat the environment?"
- "Why do Christians think Jesus had to die? Couldn't God have just forgiven everyone without the cross?"
- "I'm going to argue that what you do in life doesn't matter because God's grace saves everyone anyway — challenge me on that."
- "A Christian and an atheist both do charitable work. Does the Christian teaching on salvation mean one matters more than the other?"
