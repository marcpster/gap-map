# 10. Theme F: Religion, Human Rights and Social Justice

## Key Concepts

### 10.1 Human Rights
- **UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948):** 30 articles setting out fundamental rights — right to life, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, right to education, right to a fair trial
- **Religious attitudes to rights and responsibilities:** Christians believe all humans are made in God's image (imago Dei) — this gives everyone inherent dignity and rights; "So God created mankind in his own image" (Genesis 1:27)
- Islam teaches that all people are equal before Allah — rights come with responsibilities (e.g. the right to wealth comes with the duty of Zakah)
- Both religions teach that rights must be balanced with responsibilities to God and to others
- Non-religious perspective: secular humanism grounds human rights in shared humanity and reason, not divine authority

### 10.2 Prejudice and Discrimination
- **Prejudice:** pre-judging someone without knowledge — an attitude
- **Discrimination:** acting on prejudice — treating someone unfairly because of a characteristic
- **Racism:** discrimination based on race or ethnicity; "There is neither Jew nor Gentile... for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28); "No Arab has superiority over a non-Arab" (Hadith — Muhammad's final sermon)
- **Sexism:** discrimination based on gender; debated within religions (see 10.4)
- **Religious discrimination:** treating someone unfairly because of their religion or belief
- Both Christianity and Islam teach that all people are equal before God and that prejudice is wrong
- "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Mark 12:31) — applies regardless of race, gender, or background
- Surah 49:13 — "We have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another" — diversity is part of God's plan, not a basis for discrimination

### 10.3 Religious Freedom
- The right to practise, change, or express religious beliefs — protected under Article 18 of the UDHR
- The right to convert to a different religion or to have no religion
- **Limits of tolerance:** most agree freedom of belief should be protected, but debate arises when beliefs lead to actions that harm others or conflict with the law
- **Christianity:** Jesus taught love for all, including enemies (Matthew 5:44); most Christians support religious freedom; some tension over evangelism vs respecting other faiths
- **Islam:** "There is no compulsion in religion" (Surah 2:256) — often cited to support religious freedom; however, apostasy (leaving Islam) is viewed differently across Muslim communities — some see it as a serious sin, others emphasise the Qur'anic principle of no compulsion
- Non-religious view: freedom of belief is a fundamental human right, but no religion should have special privileges in law; secularism protects everyone's freedom equally

### 10.4 Prejudice and Discrimination in Religion
- **Role of women in Christianity:** Catholic and Orthodox churches do not ordain women as priests (tradition, Jesus chose male apostles); Church of England ordains women as priests and bishops (since 1994/2015); Galatians 3:28 supports equality; some cite 1 Corinthians 14:34 — "Women should remain silent in the churches" — but many argue this is culturally specific
- **Role of women in Islam:** men and women are spiritually equal before Allah; Surah 4:1 — created from a single soul; women have rights to education, property, and divorce in Islamic law; debate over interpretation — some communities restrict women's roles, others point to Khadijah (Muhammad's wife) as a businesswoman and first convert
- **Attitudes to homosexuality:** traditional Christian and Muslim teachings consider homosexual acts sinful (Leviticus 18:22; references to the people of Lut in the Qur'an); liberal Christians increasingly affirm same-sex relationships — "God is love" (1 John 4:8); some Muslim scholars distinguish between orientation and action; non-religious view — sexuality is a matter of personal freedom and human rights

### 10.5 Wealth and Poverty
- **Causes of poverty:** war and conflict, corruption, lack of education, unfair trade, natural disasters, debt
- **Christianity:** "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God" (Mark 10:25) — wealth can be a spiritual danger; Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31) — ignoring the poor has eternal consequences; "Faith without deeds is dead" (James 2:26) — Christians must act on their beliefs
- **Islam:** wealth is a blessing from Allah but comes with responsibility; Zakah (2.5% of savings given annually) is one of the Five Pillars — obligatory, not optional; Khums (Shi'a — 20% of surplus income); hoarding wealth is condemned
- **Responsible use of money:** both religions teach that wealth should be earned honestly and shared generously; neither condemns wealth itself — only its misuse or the neglect of those in need

### 10.6 Exploitation of the Poor
- **Fair trade:** ensuring producers in developing countries receive a fair price for their goods; supported by many religious organisations as an expression of justice
- **Debt:** developing countries often owe huge debts to wealthy nations; interest payments trap them in poverty; Jubilee 2000 campaign (supported by churches) called for debt cancellation; Islam prohibits charging interest (riba) — Surah 2:275
- **Religious responses:** Christians follow the Parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37) — help those in need regardless of who they are; Muslims follow the principle of Ummah — the global Muslim community has a duty of mutual care; both religions condemn exploitation and call for justice
- Surah 4:135 — "Stand firmly for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even if it be against yourselves"

### 10.7 Charity
- **Christianity:** "Faith without deeds is dead" (James 2:26) — belief must lead to action; the Parable of the Sheep and Goats (Matthew 25:31-46) — helping the hungry, thirsty, and stranger is serving Christ; tithing (giving a proportion of income to the church) is practised by many Christians
- **Christian Aid:** works in developing countries to tackle poverty, inequality, and injustice; motivated by Christian values of love and justice; campaigns for systemic change as well as providing direct aid
- **Islam:** Zakah is compulsory — one of the Five Pillars; Sadaqah is voluntary charity — encouraged at all times; "The reward of an evil deed is its equivalent, but whoever pardons and makes reconciliation, his reward is with Allah" (Surah 42:40) — generosity and mercy are central
- **Islamic Relief:** provides emergency aid and long-term development; motivated by Islamic principles of mercy and justice; works with communities of all faiths and none
- Non-religious perspective: charity is a moral duty based on shared humanity; secular charities (e.g. Oxfam) work on similar principles without religious motivation; some argue systemic change (policy, trade reform) matters more than individual giving

## Common Misconceptions

- Human rights are a modern Western invention with no basis in religion (both Christianity and Islam have long traditions of teaching about justice, dignity, and care for the vulnerable)
- Islam oppresses women (Islamic law grants women rights to education, property, and divorce; restrictions often reflect cultural practice rather than religious teaching)
- All religious people oppose homosexuality (there is significant diversity of opinion within both Christianity and Islam)
- Zakah is the same as voluntary charity (Zakah is obligatory — one of the Five Pillars; Sadaqah is the voluntary element)
- Christianity teaches that being rich is sinful (it teaches that the love of money is dangerous, not that wealth itself is wrong — 1 Timothy 6:10)
- Religious freedom means any action taken in the name of religion is acceptable (freedom of belief is protected, but actions that harm others can still be limited by law)
- Fair trade solves global poverty (it helps individual producers but does not address the systemic causes of inequality)

### Q1 — Human rights
**Area:** 10.1 Human rights
**Question:** "What is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and give two examples of rights it includes?"
**Looking for:** The UDHR was adopted by the United Nations in 1948. It sets out fundamental rights that apply to all people. Any two from: right to life, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, right to education, right to a fair trial, freedom from torture, right to asylum. Brief identification is sufficient.

### Q2 — Prejudice and discrimination
**Area:** 10.2 Prejudice and discrimination
**Question:** "What is the difference between prejudice and discrimination? Give an example of each."
**Looking for:** Prejudice = pre-judging someone without knowledge — an attitude or belief. Discrimination = acting on prejudice — treating someone unfairly. Example of prejudice: assuming someone is less intelligent because of their race. Example of discrimination: refusing someone a job because of their gender or religion. Clear distinction between attitude and action.

### Q3 — Wealth and poverty
**Area:** 10.5 Wealth and poverty
**Question:** "Explain two religious teachings about how wealth should be used."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Christianity — "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God" (Mark 10:25) — wealth can distract from God, so it must be used responsibly, (2) Islam — Zakah is obligatory (2.5% of savings) — wealth must be shared with those in need as a duty to Allah, (3) Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus — ignoring the poor while living in luxury has consequences, (4) wealth is a blessing from Allah but must be earned honestly and not hoarded. Each point stated and then developed with significance.

### Q4 — Charity
**Area:** 10.7 Charity
**Question:** "Explain two ways religious believers put their beliefs about helping the poor into practice."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) Zakah — Muslims give 2.5% of savings annually as one of the Five Pillars; it purifies wealth and supports those in need, (2) Christian Aid — works to tackle poverty and injustice in developing countries, motivated by Christian teachings on love and justice, (3) Islamic Relief — provides emergency aid and long-term development based on Islamic principles, (4) Sadaqah — voluntary charity encouraged in Islam, (5) tithing — Christians give a proportion of income to the church and charitable causes, (6) "Faith without deeds is dead" (James 2:26) — belief must lead to practical action. Each point explained with connection to religious motivation.

### Q5 — Religious teachings on equality
**Area:** 10.2 / 10.4
**Question:** "Explain two religious teachings about why all people should be treated equally. Refer to a source of wisdom and authority in your answer."
**Looking for:** Two developed points from: (1) "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Galatians 3:28) — all people are equal in God's eyes regardless of background, (2) Surah 49:13 — "We have made you into nations and tribes so that you may know one another" — diversity is God's design, not a basis for discrimination, (3) "No Arab has superiority over a non-Arab" (Muhammad's final sermon) — racism contradicts Islamic teaching, (4) all humans made in God's image (Genesis 1:27) — inherent dignity for everyone, (5) "Love your neighbour as yourself" (Mark 12:31) — no exceptions based on race, gender, or status. Must include at least one specific scripture reference with development.

### Q6 — Prejudice and discrimination within religion
**Area:** 10.4 Prejudice and discrimination in religion
**Question:** "Religion is the biggest cause of discrimination in the world today. Discuss this statement. You should include different, supported points of view and a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for the statement:** some religious teachings have been used to justify discrimination against women (1 Corinthians 14:34, restrictions on female ordination); traditional teachings on homosexuality cause harm to LGBTQ+ people; religious conflicts (sectarian violence, persecution of other faiths); historically, religion was used to justify slavery and colonialism
- **Arguments against the statement:** both Christianity and Islam teach fundamental equality — Galatians 3:28, Surah 49:13; religious organisations have led anti-discrimination movements (Martin Luther King Jr, Desmond Tutu); discrimination also comes from secular sources — nationalism, political ideology, economic self-interest; many religious people actively campaign against prejudice; discrimination often reflects culture, not authentic religious teaching
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view engaging with the complexity — religion can be used to discriminate but also provides powerful arguments against discrimination
- **Level indicators:** L4 = developed arguments from multiple perspectives with specific teachings and real-world examples, justified conclusion that addresses the nuance; L1 = simple opinion, no evidence or reasoning

### Q7 — Wealth, poverty, and responsibility (cross-religious evaluation)
**Area:** 10.5 / 10.6 / 10.7
**Question:** "Religious people have a greater responsibility to help the poor than non-religious people do. Discuss this statement. You should refer to Christian and Muslim teachings and non-religious arguments in your answer, and reach a justified conclusion."
**Looking for:**
- **Arguments for:** Christianity explicitly commands action — "Faith without deeds is dead" (James 2:26); Parable of the Sheep and Goats (Matthew 25:31-46) — judgement based on helping those in need; Zakah is one of the Five Pillars of Islam — not optional but obligatory; both religions teach that wealth is given by God and must be shared; religious charities (Christian Aid, Islamic Relief) demonstrate this duty in practice
- **Arguments against:** non-religious people also feel moral responsibility to help — secular humanism values compassion and justice; the UDHR (1948) establishes rights and duties for all people regardless of religion; utilitarian arguments — reducing suffering benefits everyone; some non-religious organisations (Oxfam, Doctors Without Borders) do enormous work without religious motivation; making it a specifically religious duty implies non-religious people have less obligation, which is unfair
- **Conclusion:** Justified personal view — many candidates may argue that the responsibility is equal but the motivation differs; the best answers will explore whether religious commands (Zakah, the Sheep and Goats) create an additional layer of accountability rather than a greater responsibility
- **Level indicators:** L4 = well-argued with developed reasoning from Christian, Muslim, and non-religious perspectives, specific teachings cited accurately, justified conclusion that addresses whether motivation affects responsibility; L1 = simple opinion, one religion or none referenced

## Guided Mode — Probe Questions

- "What human rights do you think are the most important? Why those ones above others?"
- "Can you think of a time when two human rights might conflict with each other — say, freedom of religion and equality? How would you resolve that?"
- "Both Christianity and Islam teach equality, but both have been accused of discriminating against women. How do you square those two things?"
- "I'm going to argue that as long as you pay your taxes, you've done your bit for the poor — you shouldn't have to give to charity on top. Convince me otherwise."
- "Is there a difference between Zakah and the taxes you pay to the government? Why might a Muslim say Zakah matters more?"
- "Some people say fair trade is just a feel-good label that doesn't actually solve poverty. What do you reckon — does it make a real difference?"
- "If God made everyone equal, why do some religious communities still treat men and women differently? Is that hypocrisy, or is there a coherent argument behind it?"
