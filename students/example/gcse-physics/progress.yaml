    notes: "Good conceptual understanding of terminal velocity and Newton's Third Law. Terminology gaps on mass vs weight (uses 'stuff' and 'heavy' rather than kg/N). Confuses speed with force on Q2. Cannot yet apply F = ma."

    sub_topics:
      "5.1_forces_interactions":
        confidence: okay
        notes: "Gets mass vs weight distinction conceptually but missing correct units and terminology"
      "5.6_motion":
        confidence: okay
        notes: "Strong on terminal velocity, weak on balanced forces (confuses speed with resultant force), F = ma not attempted"
      "5.4_moments":
        confidence: okay
        notes: "Correct intuition about pivot distance but no reference to moments formula M = Fd"
    responses:
      Q1:
        question: "What's the difference between mass and weight? Would either of them change if you went to the Moon?"
        answer: "Mass is the amount of stuff in something and weight is how heavy it is. Weight would change on the Moon because there's less gravity."
        assessment: okay
        notes: "Correct distinction and Moon reasoning. Terminology gap — says 'stuff' not 'amount of matter', 'heavy' not 'gravitational force'. No mention of units (kg, N)."
      Q2:
        question: "A car is driving at a steady 30mph on a straight road. What's the overall resultant force on the car?"
        answer: "I think it's 30 because it's going at 30?"
        assessment: weak
        notes: "Confuses speed with force — classic misconception. Doesn't recognise that constant speed means balanced forces and zero resultant force."
      Q3:
        question: "I push against a wall and it doesn't move. Is the wall pushing back on me?"
        answer: "Yeah the wall pushes back, that's why I don't go through it."
        assessment: okay
        notes: "Correct intuition about reaction force. Doesn't name Newton's Third Law or mention equal and opposite forces acting on different objects."
      Q4:
        question: "When a skydiver jumps out of a plane, they speed up at first but then eventually fall at a constant speed. Why do they stop accelerating?"
        answer: "Because the air resistance gets bigger and eventually equals the weight so they stop speeding up."
        assessment: strong
        notes: "Excellent answer — covers increasing air resistance, equilibrium with weight, and resulting constant speed. Could name 'terminal velocity' but the explanation is spot on."
      Q5:
        question: "A 1000kg car accelerates at 2 metres per second squared. Calculate the force needed to produce that acceleration."
        answer: "[no answer given]"
        assessment: weak
        notes: "No answer given — F = ma application not assessed. May not know the formula."
      Q6:
        question: "Two children are on a seesaw and one is heavier than the other. Without anyone getting off or adding any weight, how could they balance it?"
        answer: "The heavier one moves closer to the middle."
        assessment: okay
        notes: "Correct idea — move heavier child closer to pivot. No mention of moments formula (M = Fd) or principle of moments."
