# Forces — Tutor Brief: Example

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Mode:** diagnostic
**Overall confidence:** okay

## Per-Question Breakdown

| Q | Area | Confidence | Observation |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | 5.1 Forces and their interactions | okay | Correct distinction, correct Moon reasoning. Missing units (kg, N) and precise terminology |
| 2 | 5.6 Motion / Newton's First Law | weak | Confuses speed (30mph) with resultant force — doesn't recognise balanced forces at constant velocity |
| 3 | 5.6 Motion / Newton's Third Law | okay | Correct intuition about reaction force. Doesn't name N3L or mention equal/opposite on different objects |
| 4 | 5.6 Motion / terminal velocity | strong | Covers increasing air resistance, equilibrium with weight, constant speed. Could name terminal velocity |
| 5 | 5.6 Motion / Newton's Second Law | weak | No answer given — may not know F = ma |
| 6 | 5.4 Moments | okay | Correct idea (heavier child closer to pivot). No reference to M = Fd or principle of moments |

## Misconceptions Detected
- **Speed = force confusion (Q2):** Answered "30 because it's going at 30" — conflates speed with resultant force. Maps to Common Misconception: "Thinking 'no resultant force' means 'no forces at all'"

## Gap Analysis
- **5.6 Newton's First Law:** Doesn't connect constant velocity to balanced/zero resultant force
- **5.6 Newton's Second Law (F = ma):** Not attempted — formula may be unknown
- **5.1 Terminology:** Uses everyday language rather than physics terms (kg, N, gravitational force)
- **5.4 Moments formula:** Understands the principle intuitively but can't formalise it

## Recommended Focus for Next Session
1. **Balanced forces and resultant force (5.6)** — directly address the speed ≠ force misconception with worked examples
2. **F = ma calculations (5.6)** — introduce the formula, practise with simple numbers to build confidence
3. **Terminology and units (5.1)** — weave correct terms into conversation rather than drilling separately
