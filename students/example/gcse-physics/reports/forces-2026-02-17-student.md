# Forces — What You Showed

**Date:** 17 February 2026

## What you did well
- Your explanation of why a skydiver reaches a constant speed was brilliant — you nailed the idea that air resistance builds up until it matches weight
- You knew the wall pushes back on you, which shows good instincts about how forces work in pairs
- You correctly identified that weight changes on the Moon because gravity is weaker there

## What to focus on next
- Learn the key units: mass is measured in **kg**, weight is measured in **N** (Newtons)
- When something moves at a steady speed, the forces on it are **balanced** — the resultant force is zero, not the same as the speed
- Have a go at the formula **F = ma** (force = mass × acceleration) — once you know it, calculation questions become straightforward

## Key things to remember
- Weight = mass × gravitational field strength (W = mg)
- Force = mass × acceleration (F = ma)
- Moment = force × distance from pivot (M = Fd)
- Constant speed = balanced forces = zero resultant force
