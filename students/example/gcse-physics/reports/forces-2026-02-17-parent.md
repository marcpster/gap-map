# GCSE Physics Progress Update — Example

**Topic:** Forces
**Date:** 17 February 2026

## What Example demonstrated well
- Gave an excellent explanation of why skydivers reach a constant speed — showing real understanding, not just memorisation
- Correctly identified that weight changes on the Moon and that a wall pushes back when you push it
- Shows good scientific instincts and is willing to reason through problems

## Areas for development
- Learning the correct scientific units and terminology — they understand the ideas but need to express them in exam-ready language
- Understanding what happens to forces when something moves at a steady speed (a common exam topic)
- Getting comfortable with physics calculations using formulas like Force = mass × acceleration

## How you can help at home
- When watching TV or out and about, ask "what forces are acting on that?" — cars, bikes, falling objects are all great examples
- BBC Bitesize has short videos on Forces that reinforce what we cover in sessions
- Encourage them to practise simple calculations — even just plugging numbers into F = ma builds confidence
