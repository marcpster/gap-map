# Forces and Loads — Tutor Brief: Example

**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Mode:** diagnostic
**Overall confidence:** okay

## Per-Question Breakdown

| Q | Area | Confidence | Observation |
|---|------|-----------|-------------|
| 1 | 1.1 Compression and tension | strong | Correctly identifies compression on top, tension on bottom. Uses terms naturally without prompting |
| 2 | 1.2 Equilibrium | okay | Gets "balanced forces" but frames it as bridge being "strong enough". No mention of support reactions |
| 3 | 1.3 Dead loads and live loads | weak | Thinks dead load = no load on bridge. Misses that dead load is self-weight. Live load roughly correct |
| 4 | 1.4 How forces travel through structures | weak | No answer given — concept of forces travelling through structural elements not yet encountered |

## Misconceptions Detected
- **Dead load = empty bridge (Q3):** Interprets "dead" as absence of load rather than the bridge's permanent self-weight. Maps to Common Misconception: "Live loads are always bigger than dead loads" — hasn't grasped that the bridge itself is a major load

## Gap Analysis
- **1.3 Dead vs live loads:** Core distinction not understood — needs explicit teaching that the bridge's own weight is a load it must carry
- **1.4 Load paths:** Not attempted — introduce the concept of forces travelling through different elements (deck → cables → towers → foundations)
- **1.2 Equilibrium terminology:** Understands intuitively but needs the vocabulary: equilibrium, reaction forces, supports

## Recommended Focus for Next Session
1. **Dead load concept (1.3)** — use a concrete example: "this bridge weighs 500 tonnes before a single car crosses it" to establish that self-weight is a load
2. **Load paths (1.4)** — walk through a suspension bridge step by step, tracing force from car to ground, naming each element
3. **Equilibrium language (1.2)** — weave "equilibrium" and "reaction forces" into conversation when the student uses "balanced" or "strong enough"
