# Forces and Loads — What You Showed

**Date:** 17 February 2026

## What you did well
- Your answer about the plank was spot on — you correctly identified that the top gets compressed and the bottom gets stretched, and you even used the right terminology without being told it
- You recognised that a bridge holding a lorry must have its forces balanced, which is exactly the right instinct
- You had a good go at the dead/live loads question even though you weren't sure — having a think about it and guessing is always better than skipping

## What to focus on next
- **Dead load** doesn't mean "no load" — it's the permanent weight of the bridge itself. The bridge is always carrying its own weight, even when nothing is on it. **Live load** is the stuff that comes and goes (traffic, people, wind)
- When forces balance on a bridge, it's called **equilibrium** — and the balancing forces come from the supports pushing upward (not just from the bridge being "strong enough")
- Have a think about how forces travel through a suspension bridge — from the deck, up through the cables, down through the towers, and into the ground. This is called a **load path**

## Key things to remember
- Compression = squeezing (pushing inward). Tension = stretching (pulling apart)
- Dead load = the bridge's own permanent weight. Live load = traffic, wind, people
- Equilibrium = all forces balanced. The supports push up to match the loads pushing down
